## HOSPITAL COURSE

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest tightness. On arrival, patient was hypoxemic and hypotensive.

**History of Present Illness:**  
42F with PMHx notable for recurrent viral sinusitis, multiple pregnancies, and no prior cardiac history, presented to the ED with a 10-day history of worsening dyspnea, cough, and malaise. She developed acute respiratory distress and was found to be in cardiogenic shock on arrival. Initial workup revealed severely reduced LVEF (~10% by bedside echo), lactic acidosis, and multi-organ dysfunction. She required emergent intubation and vasopressor support. Given refractory shock, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 1 in the MICU.  

**Hospital Days 1-12:**  
- HD1: Intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure, started on norepinephrine, dobutamine.  
- HD1: Impella CP placed for cardiogenic shock due to suspected viral myocarditis.  
- HD2: Renal function declined, started on CVVH.  
- HD3: Weaned off norepinephrine, still requiring Impella support.  
- HD4: Developed fever, started empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc, cefepime).  
- HD5: LFTs peaked, concern for ischemic hepatitis.  
- HD6-8: Gradual improvement in cardiac function (LVEF up to 25%).  
- HD9: Impella weaned off, device explanted.  
- HD10: Extubated to BiPAP.  
- HD11: Transitioned to nasal cannula, off pressors, renal function improving.  
- HD12: Transferred to step-down unit.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to acute viral myocarditis**  
- Likely viral etiology (rhinovirus/enterovirus PCR positive).  
- Required percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for 8 days.  
- Now off device, echo shows recovering LVEF (now 35%).  
- Plan: Continue guideline-directed medical therapy for HF (metoprolol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone), monitor for arrhythmias, telemetry, serial echocardiograms, avoid volume overload.

**2. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure**  
- Intubated HD1-10, now extubated and on nasal cannula.  
- CXR: Bilateral infiltrates, likely pulmonary edema.  
- Plan: Diuresis as tolerated, pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry.

**3. Acute kidney injury (AKI), stage 3**  
- Oliguric on HD2, required CVVH x3 days, now off.  
- Creatinine peaked 4.1, now trending down.  
- Plan: Strict I/O, daily BMP, avoid nephrotoxins.

**4. Transaminitis / Ischemic Hepatitis**  
- AST/ALT peaked >2000/1500, now downtrending.  
- Likely secondary to low flow state.  
- Plan: Monitor LFTs, supportive care.

**5. Hospital-acquired infection**  
- Fever on HD4, blood cultures negative, urine culture grew E. coli.  
- Treated with cefepime x7 days.  
- Plan: Continue to monitor for infectious complications.

**6. Anxiety / Delirium**  
- ICU delirium, managed with reorientation, sleep hygiene, melatonin.

**7. Contraception / Reproductive health**  
- Multiple forms of contraception on med list (Yaz, etonogestrel implant, medroxyprogesterone).  
- OB/GYN consulted, all current contraception deemed safe.

**8. Dyslipidemia**  
- LDL 97, on statin therapy.  
- Plan: Continue atorvastatin 40mg qHS.

**9. Pain, mild**  
- Numeric rating ~3/10, managed with acetaminophen.

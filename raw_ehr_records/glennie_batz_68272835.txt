**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and chest tightness.

**History of Present Illness:**  
53-year-old female with h/o prediabetes, chronic sinusitis, anemia, and remote concussion, presenting with 1 week of worsening exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and bilateral leg swelling. She developed acute chest discomfort and was brought to the ED. Initial workup revealed elevated BNP and troponin, low ejection fraction (EF 18%), and cardiogenic shock with hypotension refractory to inotropes. She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and transferred to the MICU, where a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed for hemodynamic support. She has been treated for possible viral myocarditis; infectious w/u pending.

- Monitor for arrhythmias, Impella-related complications  
- Repeat echo planned 5/30  
- Await viral panel, cardiac MRI pending  
- Cardiology following

**2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, intubated**  
- Ventilator support, wean FiO2 as tolerated  
- Daily CXR, suction ETT prn  
- Monitor for VAP, SBT trial if mental status improves

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**  
- Initially oliguric, Cr peaked 1.7, now improved  
- Monitor UOP, avoid nephrotoxins  
- Renal dosing of medications

**4. Anemia, transfusion-dependent**  
- Hb nadir 7.6, transfused 2U PRBC  
- Iron studies pending, continue ferrous sulfate  
- Monitor for GI blood loss

**5. Transaminitis, likely ischemic hepatitis**  
- LFTs peaked 5/24, now trending down  
- Monitor daily, trend with hemodynamics

**6. Prediabetes**  
- Glucose controlled, continue monitoring  
- Endocrinology consulted

**7. Chronic/recurrent sinusitis**  
- Completed amox/clav for recent flare  
- Monitor for secondary infection

**8. DVT prophylaxis**  
- Heparin SQ

**9. Pain/agitation/sedation**  
- Propofol for sedation, pain score goal <4  
- Monitor for delirium as sedation weaned

**10. Nutrition**  
- NPO, TPN not indicated  
- Enteral nutrition via OG tube initiated 5/26

**11. Family/Goals of Care**  
- Family updated daily, full code  
- Social work involved for support

---

**To Do:**  
- Repeat echo 5/30  
- Continue Impella wean, reassess for explant  
- Monitor labs, adjust meds  
- SBT trial when appropriate  
- Await viral panel, cardiac MRI  
- Daily multidisciplinary rounds

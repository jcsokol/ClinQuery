### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
37-year-old male with PMHx of chronic sinusitis, prediabetes, and recent viral sinusitis (treated with amox/clav), presented to ED with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest tightness. On arrival, hypotensive (BP 79/55), tachycardic (HR 122), tachypneic (RR 26), and hypoxic (O2 sat 89% RA). Physical exam notable for JVD, S3, cool extremities, and mild bibasilar crackles.

## ICU HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**HD 1:** Admitted in cardiogenic shock, intubated, started on norepinephrine, dopamine. Emergent Impella CP placed. Echo: EF 15%.  
**HD 2:** Hemodynamics stabilizing on Impella, weaned off dopamine. Pressors titrated.  
**HD 3:** Improved end-organ perfusion. Lactate normalized. Attempted to wean Impella support.  
**HD 4:** Developed fever (38.6°C), blood cultures drawn, started empiric vancomycin/cefepime.  
**HD 5:** Improved, extubated. Impella weaned and explanted without complication.  
**HD 6-7:** Diuresis initiated, transitioned to guideline-directed HF therapy (metoprolol, lasix, spironolactone).  
**HD 8:** Transferred to step-down unit.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**37M with no significant cardiac history, presented in cardiogenic shock, likely acute viral myocarditis, requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP). Hospital course complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia, now resolved.**

**Problem-Based A/P:**

1. **Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated HF**
    - Impella CP placed HD 1, explanted HD 5.
    - Initially on norepi/dopamine, now off all pressors.
    - Diuresed, started on metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily, lasix 40 mg IV BID, spironolactone 25 mg daily.
    - Echo to be repeated prior to discharge.
    - Cardiac MRI pending for myocarditis evaluation.
    - Daily weights, strict I/O, monitor for arrhythmia.

2. **Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, improved)**
    - Cr peaked at 1.42, now 0.98.
    - Improved with hemodynamic stabilization.
    - Continue to monitor renal function.

3. **Possible Ventilator-associated pneumonia (HD 4-5)**
    - Treated empirically with vanc/cefepime.
    - Afebrile since HD 5, blood cultures negative.
    - Antibiotics discontinued.

4. **Prediabetes**
    - A1c 6.0%.
    - Glucose controlled in hospital.
    - Dietician consulted, recommend lifestyle modification.

5. **Chronic Sinusitis**
    - No acute symptoms.
    - ENT follow-up as outpatient.

6. **Hyperlipidemia**
    - LDL 83, HDL 67, TG 139.
    - Consider statin therapy after acute phase.

7. **DVT Prophylaxis**
    - SCDs, started enoxaparin 40 mg SQ daily.

8. **Physical Debilitation**
    - PT/OT evaluation, reconditioning post-ICU.

9. **Follow-up**
    - Cardiology, HF clinic, repeat TTE, consider wearable defibrillator pending EF recovery.

---

**Discharge Goals:**  
- Clinically euvolemic, stable on oral HF meds, ambulatory, normal renal function, no active infection.

---

### ORDERS

- Metoprolol succinate 25 mg PO daily
- Furosemide 40 mg IV BID, transition to PO when stable

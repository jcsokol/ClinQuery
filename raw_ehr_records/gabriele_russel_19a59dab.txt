# HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

71-year-old female with PMHx significant for atrial fibrillation (on warfarin and digoxin), osteoarthritis of the hip, early onset familial Alzheimer’s dementia, and prior rotator cuff injury, presented to the ED with worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and progressive confusion. Daughter reports decreased oral intake, productive cough, and increased lethargy. Noted to be tachycardic and hypoxic on arrival. CXR: pulmonary edema. ECG: Afib with RVR. Initial troponin mildly elevated. BUN/Cr uptrending. BNP 2430 pg/mL. Initial TTE: severely reduced LVEF (~18%), global hypokinesis, moderate MR.  

Worsening hemodynamics despite diuresis and rate control. Developed hypotension and progressive oliguria. Required transfer to CICU for escalating vasopressor support. Due to persistent cardiogenic shock, decision made for placement of percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2.

# HOSPITAL COURSE

**Day 1:**  
Admitted to CICU, started on BiPAP, furosemide drip, and diltiazem. Warfarin held for INR 3.1. Developed hypotension (BP 82/54), MAP <60. Started norepinephrine.  

**Day 2:**  
Worsening renal function (Cr 2.8 from baseline 1.0), rising lactate (4.1 mmol/L), persistent low output state. Family meeting. Placed Impella CP for temporary LV support. Hemodynamics improved.  

**Day 3-6:**  
Gradual wean off vasopressors. Urine output improved, but still some confusion and mild delirium. Weaned to high-flow nasal cannula. Developed mild transaminitis and thrombocytopenia. Serial TTE: LVEF improved to 26%. Impella weaned and removed day 6.  

**Day 7-10:**  
Stable on oral HF regimen (metoprolol, low-dose lisinopril, spironolactone). Rate controlled. Out of bed with PT. Renal function recovering. Plan for SNF placement.

# IMAGING

- **CXR (5/14/24):** Pulmonary edema, small bilateral effusions
- **TTE (5/14/24):** LVEF 18%, severe diffuse hypokinesis, moderate MR, mild TR
- **TTE (5/19/24):** LVEF 26%, improved, Impella in situ

---

# ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / ADHF (EF 18%)**
   - Required Impella CP for LV support (day 2-6)
   - Ongoing HF management: diuresis, ACEi, BB, spironolactone
   - Monitor volume status, electrolytes, renal function
   - Plan: TTE prior to discharge, adjust meds for recovery

**2. Atrial Fibrillation, rate control**
   - On digoxin, transitioned verapamil → metoprolol after stabilization
   - Anticoagulation: warfarin resumed after INR <2.5
   - Monitor for recurrence of RVR

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**
   - Likely pre-renal, improved with volume optimization
   - Daily BMP, monitor for further rise in Cr

**4. Dementia (familial early onset)**
   - Baseline MMSE 18/30
   - Confusion worsened with acute illness, some delirium
   - Reorientation, minimize sedatives

**5. Transaminitis / Thrombocytopenia**
   - Likely secondary to shock liver, Impella
   - Trending down, monitor LFTs and platelets

**6. Osteoarthritis (hip)**
   - Pain controlled, PT to assist with mobility

**7. Rotator cuff injury (remote)**
   - No acute issues

**8. Recent bronchitis, sinusitis**
   - Completed antibiotics, no ongoing infection

**9. Disposition**
   - Plan for SNF placement with PT/OT, close cardiology follow-up

# ORDERS & CONSULTS

- Resume warfarin, target INR 2-3
- PT/OT eval
- Diet: Cardiac, 2g Na
- Case management for SNF placement

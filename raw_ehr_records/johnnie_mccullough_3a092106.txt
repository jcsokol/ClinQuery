## ICU Progress Note

### Chief Complaint
Acute decompensated heart failure, shock, and worsening dyspnea.

### HPI
Johnnie McCullough is a 44-year-old male with PMHx of type 2 DM (with neuropathy), metabolic syndrome, chronic sinusitis, anemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. He presented to the ED with 5 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He was found to be hypoxic (SpO2 87% RA), febrile to 38.1°C, and hypotensive (BP 82/54). Initial labs showed acute kidney injury, elevated lactate, and troponin leak. CXR revealed pulmonary vascular congestion, and TTE showed severe LV dysfunction (EF 18%), global hypokinesis, and moderate MR. He was transferred to MICU for cardiogenic shock and required norepinephrine and dobutamine. Due to persistent shock and end-organ dysfunction, a percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 1.

### Hospital Course Summary

- **HD 1-2:** Persistent hypotension despite escalating vasoactive support. Impella placed with subsequent improvement in MAP and urine output.
- **HD 3-4:** Diuresis initiated, volume status improved. Renal function slowly recovering. Developed fever, treated empirically for VAP.
- **HD 5-6:** Impella weaned and explanted. Cardiac function remains severely depressed. Slow wean off pressors.
- **HD 7+:** Continued management of heart failure, DM, and secondary infections. Endocrine consult for persistent hyperglycemia.

## Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (EF 18%)
- Etiology: Ischemic vs non-ischemic (likely multifactorial; no acute STEMI on EKG, troponin leak, metabolic syndrome).
- **Course:** Required Impella CP for 5 days, now explanted. HD stable on minimal norepinephrine.
- **Plan:**
  - Continue GDMT (initiate low-dose carvedilol, spironolactone when stable)
  - Serial ECHO to assess recovery
  - Daily weights, strict I/Os, sodium restriction
  - Cardiology f/u for advanced therapies (possible evaluation for durable LVAD if poor recovery)
  - Continue VTE prophylaxis

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO Stage 2)
- Likely pre-renal from shock, possibly nephrotoxic agents.
- **Course:** Creatinine peaked at 2.4, now downtrending (see labs).
- **Plan:**
  - Avoid nephrotoxins, monitor labs qAM
  - Adjust meds for renal dosing
  - Nephrology consult if worsening

### 3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (HgbA1c 7.1%)
- Stress hyperglycemia on steroids and vasopressors.
- **Plan:**
  - Sliding scale insulin
  - Endocrine consult for regimen adjustment
  - Monitor for hypoglycemia

### 4. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia / VAP
- Fever, CXR with infiltrates, sputum cultures pending.
- **Plan:**
  - Continue empiric pip/tazo & vanc
  - De-escalate based on sensitivities
  - Chest PT, early mobilization

### 5. Anemia (Baseline Hgb ~13, dropped to 9.2 post-Impella)
- Likely multifactorial: device-related hemolysis, phlebotomy, AKI.
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor Hgb
  - Iron studies, retic count
  - Transfuse if <7 or symptomatic

### 6. Neuropathy (DM-related)
- Numbness/tingling in feet, stable.
- **Plan:**
  - Continue gabapentin, foot care precautions

### 7. Metabolic Syndrome / Hyperlipidemia
- **Plan:**
  - Statin therapy (hold if LFTs >3x ULN)
  - Lifestyle counseling after discharge

### 8. Chronic Sinusitis / Viral Sinusitis
- Complaints of nasal congestion, no acute intervention needed.
- **Plan:**
  - Supportive care

### 9. Forearm Laceration (HD 2, accidental during transfer)
- Sutured, no signs of infection.
- **Plan:**
  - Daily dressing changes, monitor for cellulitis

### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Shortness of breath, chest pain, progressive lower extremity swelling.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Henrietta Pouros is a 93-year-old woman with a history of obesity, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and osteoporosis, who presented to the ED with increasing dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest discomfort for 3 days. She also reported paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and new bilateral ankle edema. No fevers, cough, or recent sick contacts. She had a syncopal episode at home this morning, prompting ED presentation.

On arrival, she was found to be tachypneic with hypoxia (O2 sat 87% RA), BP 84/62 mmHg, HR 112, temp 37.4°C. She rapidly developed acute respiratory distress and hypotension requiring urgent intubation and vasopressor support. EKG showed new LBBB. Initial labs were notable for lactic acidosis, elevated troponin and BNP, worsening renal dysfunction, and anemia.

Echo in the ED revealed severe global LV systolic dysfunction (EF 15%), moderate MR, RV moderately reduced. Due to ongoing shock (cardiogenic) refractory to pressors and inotropes, decision was made to place a percutaneous temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) emergently in the cath lab.

### HOSPITAL COURSE (ICU Days 1-7)

- **Day 1:** Intubated, sedated. Impella CP placed, improved MAP >65 mmHg. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine, furosemide drip. CVP 18, PCWP 32. CXR: bilateral pulmonary edema. Foley, A-line, central line placed. Nephrology consulted for worsening AKI.
- **Day 2:** Pressors weaned off overnight. Remains intubated, negative fluid balance. Creatinine peaked at 3.2, now 2.8. Mild improvement in urine output. Blood cultures negative. Echo: LV function unchanged.
- **Day 3:** Developed fever (38.5°C), WBC 13.2. Started empiric pip-tazo. Sputum culture sent. Extubated to BiPAP. Impella flows stable.
- **Day 4:** Improved respiratory status, now on HFNC. AKI slowly improving. Diuresis ongoing. Troponin trending down. Impella flows decreased overnight, device repositioned.
- **Day 5:** Weaned off BiPAP to nasal cannula. Pressors off. No arrhythmias. Impella support still required for low cardiac output. Echo: EF 18%.
- **Day 6:** Impella weaned and removed after TTE demonstrated improved hemodynamics (EF up to 28%). Transitioned to inotropes overnight. Started on low-dose beta-blocker.
- **Day 7:** Hemodynamically stable, off all inotropes. Mobilized to chair. Planning transfer to step-down.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

#### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Severe LV Dysfunction (EF 15%)**
   - *Etiology:* Likely acute decompensated heart failure on background of ischemic cardiomyopathy, no acute MI
   - *Course:* Required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for 5 days, now weaned off, transitioned to inotropes, then off all support
   - *Plan:* Optimize GDMT, monitor for recurrence, daily TTE, telemetry, sodium/fluid restriction, slow diuresis, consider CRT if persistent LBBB

#### 2. **Acute on Chronic Heart Failure**
   - *Plan:* IV furosemide, strict I/O, daily weights, low sodium diet, titrate beta-blocker/ACEI as tolerated

#### 3. **Acute Kidney Injury on CKD4**
   - *Plan:* Nephrology following. Renal function improving, no need for RRT. Monitor lytes, adjust meds for renal dosing, avoid nephrotoxins

#### 4. **Anemia, likely multifactorial**
   - *Plan:* Monitor CBC, trend downtrending Hgb, no evidence of overt bleeding, GI workup deferred, iron studies pending

#### 5. **COPD Exacerbation**
   - *Plan:* Pulm following. Weaned off BiPAP, now on NC. Resume home inhalers, pulm toilet, monitor for infection

#### 6. **Infection (possible VAP vs UTI)**
   - *Plan:* Empiric pip-tazo x5d, cultures pending, afebrile, will de-escalate if negative

#### 7. **Diabetes Mellitus / Hyperglycemia**
   - *Plan:* Endo following. Sliding scale insulin, hold metformin (AKI), monitor glucose, A1c reviewed

#### 8. **Hypertension**
   - *Plan:* Restart home regimen as tolerated, monitor BP closely

#### 9. **Osteoporosis**
   - *Plan:* Continue alendronate, fall precautions, PT/OT eval prior to transfer

#### 10. **Hypertriglyceridemia/Metabolic Syndrome**
   - *Plan:* Statin deferred during AKI, dietary consult

#### 11. **Other**
   - *Plan:* DVT prophylaxis, pressure ulcer prevention, Foley removal ASAP, early mobilization

### DISPOSITION
- Anticipate transfer to step-down unit within 24-48 hours
- PT/OT evaluation for strength and mobility
- Discharge planning ongoing, high risk for readmission

# ICU ADMISSION NOTE

---

### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema x 2 weeks, acutely worsened over the past 48 hours.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Gennie Spinka is a 55-year-old female with a history of obesity, chronic sinusitis, and recent acute bronchitis who presented with worsening dyspnea, productive cough, and increasing lower extremity swelling. She reported difficulty sleeping flat, requiring several pillows, and noted a 10-lb weight gain over the last two weeks. On arrival, she was tachypneic and hypoxic. Exam revealed rales, jugular venous distension, and bilateral pitting edema. CXR showed pulmonary edema. BNP and troponin were elevated. Echo showed severe global hypokinesis, LVEF ~15%. She developed hypotension refractory to IV diuretics and dobutamine, prompting placement of a left-sided percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

**Day 2–3:**  
- Gradual wean of vasopressors  
- Ongoing diuresis, net -2.5L by day 3  
- Mild transaminitis, likely hypoperfusion  
- Monitored for hemolysis (LDH, haptoglobin)  
- Developed mild thrombocytopenia, Impella-related  
- Cough improved, no further fevers

**Day 4–5:**  
- Impella support continued  
- Renal function stable, minor rise in creatinine  
- Troponin trended down  
- Mobilized to chair  
- No arrhythmias observed

**Day 6–7:**

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock**  
- Severe LV dysfunction, likely new diagnosis  
- Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support  
- Weaned off pressors, Impella explanted Day 7  
- Initiated guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF  
- Daily weights, strict I/O, fluid restriction  
- Cardiology following

**2. Obesity**  
- Counseling on diet/exercise  
- Monitored for volume overload, renal dosing of medications

**3. Acute kidney injury (transient, likely prerenal)**  
- Monitored renal function, improved with diuresis and hemodynamic support  
- Avoided nephrotoxins

**4. Impella-related thrombocytopenia**  
- Monitored platelets daily  
- No evidence of bleeding  
- Platelets recovered after Impella removal

**5. Transaminitis, improved**  
- Monitored LFTs, trended down after improved perfusion

**6. Chronic sinusitis, acute bronchitis (resolved)**  
- No fevers, no productive cough  
- Supportive care only

**7. Hyperlipidemia**  
- Atorvastatin held during acute illness, plan to resume prior to discharge

**8. Pain management**

**10. Disposition/social**  
- Extensive education re: new heart failure diagnosis and device history  
- SW involved for possible cardiac rehab referral  
- Anticipate step-down transfer, then home with close f/u

**Chief Complaint:**  
Acute shortness of breath, chest pain, and syncope at home. EMS found pt in cardiac arrest, ROSC after 2 rounds of CPR and 1 shock. Admitted to ICU for post-arrest care.

**HPI:**  
Kara Schneider is a 47-year-old female with PMHx significant for prediabetes, anemia, prior UTI, and recent viral sinusitis, who was found unresponsive at home by her husband.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN (PROBLEM BASED)

**1. Cardiac Arrest / Cardiogenic Shock (EF 15%)**  
- S/p out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (VT) with ROSC, severe LV dysfunction.  
- Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support on 4/9.  
- Weaning vasopressors, MAP >65.  
- TTE daily, last: EF 20%, mild MR, LV dilation.  
- Cardiac markers trending down, no re-arrest.  
- Plan: Continue Impella, titrate off pressors, planned RHC if stable. Monitor for hemolysis/limb ischemia.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (likely secondary to shock, multifactorial)**  
- Creatinine peaked at 1.54, now improving.  
- UOP >0.5 cc/kg/hr.  
- Avoid nephrotoxins, monitor lytes, daily BMP.

**3. Anemia (baseline, worsened in ICU)**  
- Hgb dropped to 10.9, likely dilutional/hemolysis.  
- No overt bleeding.  
- Monitor CBC, transfuse PRBC if Hgb <7.5 or symptomatic.

**4. Prediabetes**  
- Glucose 65–91, no hypoglycemia since ICU.  
- Baseline A1c 6.4%.  
- Sliding scale insulin PRN, monitor for stress hyperglycemia.

**5. Escherichia coli UTI (recent)**  
- Positive urine cx on 4/7, started on nitrofurantoin.  
- Now afebrile, urine clear, WBC trending down.  
- Complete 7-day course.

**6. Viral Sinusitis / Acute Bronchitis**  
- Productive cough, CXR: no infiltrate or consolidation.  
- No hypoxia, no antibiotics needed.  
- Symptomatic management, chest physio.

**7. Pain/Delirium/ICU Care**  
- Mild pain (2/10), acetaminophen prn.  
- CAM-ICU negative.  
- Early PT/OT, DVT ppx, PPI for GI ppx.

**8. Disposition / Code Status**  
- Full code, discussed w/ family.  
- Will need step-down once off Impella and pressors.

### ICU COURSE HIGHLIGHTS

**Hospital Day 1:**  
- Arrival post-arrest, intubated, on norepinephrine, Impella placed.  
- Initial labs: lactate 7.2, troponin 18.4, BNP 3260.  
- Started broad-spectrum abx (later narrowed to nitrofurantoin for UTI).

**Hospital Day 2:**  
- Sedation weaned, extubated to HFNC.  
- Vasopressors weaned, UOP improved.  
- TTE showed persistent LV dysfunction.  
- No arrhythmias overnight.

**Hospital Day 3:**  
- Stable off pressors, Impella flows 3.2 L/min, no hemolysis.  
- AKI improving, WBC downtrending.  
- Family meeting: discussed prognosis, advanced therapies.

**Hospital Day 4:**  
- Impella weaning trial started.  
- Patient alert, oriented, tolerating oral intake.  
- Physical therapy initiated.  
- Plan for removal of Impella if stable overnight.

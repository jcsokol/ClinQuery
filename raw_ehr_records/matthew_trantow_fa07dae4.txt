### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive dyspnea and orthopnea, found to be in cardiogenic shock.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

35-year-old male with history notable for prediabetes, chronic anemia, allergic rhinitis, and remote right rotator cuff tendon injury, who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and PND. Initial evaluation revealed hypotension (SBP 76 mmHg), tachycardia, elevated JVP, and rales. Labs and echo were consistent with new-onset severe systolic heart failure (LVEF ~15%), likely viral myocarditis vs. idiopathic DCM. He rapidly decompensated to cardiogenic shock unresponsive to inotropes/vasopressors, requiring placement of a percutaneous temporary LV assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 1.

Course complicated by AKI, mild transaminitis, and persistent anemia. Now on ICU day 7, being weaned from temporary LVAD with improving hemodynamics.

- **Day 2-3:** AKI stage 1 (Cr peaked at 2.1), mild transaminitis. Diuresed with IV furosemide. 
- **Day 4-5:** Weaning vasopressors, Impella flows down-titrated. Hgb trended down to 8.3, required 1U PRBC.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to new severe LV systolic dysfunction (probable myocarditis/DCM)**
- Impella CP placed, now on weaning settings.  
- Off vasopressors.  
- Continue to monitor hemodynamics, daily TTE.  
- Plan to wean and explant Impella if stable x24-48h.  
- Consider advanced heart failure therapies if recovery not sustained.

**2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
- Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) started (low-dose carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan to be titrated as tolerated).
- IV diuresis ongoing, now euvolemic.
- Daily weights, strict I/Os.

**3. AKI (now resolving)**
- Volume status optimized, off nephrotoxins.
- Renal function improving, monitor labs daily.

**4. Chronic Anemia (baseline Hgb ~10-11)**
- Nadir Hgb 8.3 (5/24), transfused 1U PRBC.
- No overt bleeding, likely multifactorial (chronic + hemodilution).
- Monitor CBC, iron studies pending.

**5. Prediabetes**
- Hyperglycemia during stress, now controlled.
- Monitor FS glucose BID, A1c 6.2%.

**6. Transaminitis (mild, likely shock liver)**
- Peaked on 5/23, now improving.
- Continue to trend LFTs.

**7. Allergic Rhinitis, Sinusitis (remote, not active)**
- Continue home meds PRN.

**8. Social, Physical Therapy, Dispo**
- Early PT/OT involvement.
- Psychosocial support, case management for possible advanced therapies.

### ADDENDUMS / MISC

- Rotator cuff and foot laceration not relevant to current admission.
- All home medications reviewed, adjustments made for current status.
- Multidisciplinary rounds daily.

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY (ADMISSION DAY 12)

Ms. Gutmann is a 52-year-old woman with a history of anemia, prediabetes, osteoarthritis, allergic rhinitis, and viral sinusitis, who presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and lower extremity swelling. She was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure, complicated by cardiogenic shock refractory to initial medical therapy. She required ICU admission and placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (LVAD; Impella CP) on hospital day 2. She has since been weaned off pressors and is being bridged to decision regarding long-term management.

- **Central line (IJ), arterial line (radial), Foley cath.**

---

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, new HFrEF, s/p temporary LVAD (Impella)**  
- Acute decompensation, likely viral myocarditis (recent URI symptoms, no CAD on cath)
- LVAD required due to refractory shock. Now weaning pressors, device still in place HD 12.
- Echo: EF improved to 28% on HD 11.
- Plan: Continue device support, daily echo, wean as tolerated. Consideration for long-term device or transplant evaluation if no further improvement.  
- Monitor for arrhythmias, hemolysis, device-related complications.

**2. Anemia (chronic, multifactorial; acutely worsened by dilution/bleeding?)**  
- Hgb nadir 7.8, now 10.5. 2 units PRBCs transfused HD 2/3.
- Iron studies: ferritin 58, Fe 42, TIBC 310, TSat 12%.
- Plan: Continue iron supplementation, monitor Hgb q48h.

**3. AKI (resolved)**  
- Creatinine peaked at 1.1, now 0.7; likely pre-renal from low flow.
- Plan: Monitor urine output, maintain MAP >70, avoid nephrotoxins.

**4. Prediabetes**  
- Admission A1c 5.8%. Glucose 92-119 during stay.
- Plan: Monitor glucose, no insulin needed, continue lifestyle counseling.

**5. Perennial allergic rhinitis / chronic sinusitis**  
- Fluticasone, albuterol, chlorpheniramine as needed.
- No acute exacerbation, continue home regimen.

**6. Osteoarthritis (knee)**  
- No acute pain, off NSAIDs during ICU stay (renal/bleeding risk)
- Plan: Resume naproxen at discharge if renal function stable.

**7. Hyperlipidemia**  
- Total chol 181, LDL 85, HDL 68, TG 142.
- Plan: Start atorvastatin 20mg daily.

**8. DVT prophylaxis**  
- Enoxaparin 40mg SQ daily.  
- SCDs in place.

**9. Infection prevention**  
- No evidence of bacterial infection.  
- Monitor for VAP, CLABSI, CAUTI.

**10. Disposition**  
- Awaiting further recovery. Will reassess for device wean or bridge to advanced therapies.

### ICU Progress Note  
**Date:** 04/14/2024  
**Time:** 07:16  

---

#### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive SOB, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Admitted for acute decompensated heart failure, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support.

---

#### HPI
42F with PMH of prediabetes, chronic anemia, remote concussion, and recent URI (sinusitis, pharyngitis) who presented 4 days ago with 3 weeks of worsening dyspnea on exertion, PND, and bilateral leg swelling. On day 1 of admission, she rapidly deteriorated with hypotension, hypoxia, and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. Initiated on inotropes and subsequently required placement of a percutaneous temporary LV assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support. 

---

#### HOSPITAL COURSE (ICU DAYS 1-4)

- **Day 1:** Admitted with tachycardia (HR 116), BP 88/54, SpO2 91% on 2L NC, RR 24. Bibasilar rales, JVD, +2 LE edema. Labs notable for troponin 0.16 (modestly elevated), mild transaminitis (AST 72, ALT 58), lactate 3.2. CXR: pulmonary edema. Echo: LVEF 18%, severe global hypokinesis, no valvular vegetations, RV function preserved. Started IV furosemide, nitroglycerin, and dobutamine. Hypotension worsened, requiring norepinephrine.

- **Day 2:** Persistent shock, declining urine output (UOP <0.3 cc/kg/hr), rising creatinine (1.8 from 0.9). Impella CP placed via femoral approach. Immediate improvement in MAP and UOP. Continued diuresis and inotropes. ID consulted for persistent leukocytosis and fever. Empiric vancomycin/cefepime started, later de-escalated to amoxicillin-clavulanate after blood cultures negative and sinusitis confirmed by CT.

- **Day 3:** Improved perfusion, MAP 75-80. Weaned norepi. UOP improved, creatinine trending down. Still requiring moderate Impella support. Mild hemolysis (LDH 480, haptoglobin <15). Hgb dropped to 8.1, likely multifactorial (chronic anemia, device-related hemolysis). No bleeding. Transfused 1U PRBCs.

- **Day 4:** Continued clinical improvement. Weaned off inotropes. Impella flows stable. LFTs normalizing. Preparing for device wean and potential transfer to step-down. Patient more alert, ambulating with PT, tolerating oral diet.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic shock, acute decompensated HF (new onset, non-ischemic):**  
- Likely viral myocarditis precipitated by recent URI.
- Impella CP placed day 2, ongoing support, flows stable.
- Weaning inotropes, plan to trial Impella wean in next 24–48h.
- Continue aggressive diuresis, monitor volume status, daily weights, strict I/Os.
- Daily TTE to assess LV recovery.
- Monitor for device complications (hemolysis, limb ischemia, infection).
- Cardiology, CT surgery, and HF teams following.

**2. Acute kidney injury (pre-renal, resolving):**  
- Likely multifactorial: low perfusion, diuretics, possible nephrotoxins.
- Renal function improving post-Impella.
- Monitor labs, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal dosing.

**3. Anemia (chronic and acute on chronic):**  
- Baseline Hgb ~10, dropped to 8.1, likely device-related hemolysis + dilutional.
- 1U PRBC transfused, now stable.
- Monitor for ongoing hemolysis and overt bleeding.

**4. Fever/leukocytosis, recent URI, acute sinusitis:**  
- Empiric broad-spectrum abx, now narrowed to amox-clav per cultures/CT.
- Complete 10-day course.
- Monitor for sepsis, repeat cultures if new fever.

**5. Prediabetes:**  
- Glucose well controlled, continue fingersticks q6h while on steroids/stress.
- Endo consult if persistent hyperglycemia.

**6. Physical deconditioning:**  
- Early PT/OT.  
- DVT prophylaxis (heparin SQ).

**7. Psychosocial:**  
- Supportive care, social work consult for disposition planning, family meetings ongoing.

**8. Other:**  
- Monitor LFTs, coagulation, daily electrolytes, nutrition consult.

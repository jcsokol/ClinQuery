### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Luther Abernathy is a 45-year-old male with a history of severe obesity (BMI 41), prediabetes, anemia, and recurrent upper respiratory infections (sinusitis/bronchitis) who presented with 5 days of worsening dyspnea, cough productive of white sputum, and increasing bilateral lower extremity swelling. He denied chest pain but noted significant orthopnea requiring 4 pillows and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He was initially admitted to the floor, but on hospital day 2 developed hypotension (SBP 78 mmHg), tachycardia, and worsening hypoxia. Cardiology was consulted and bedside echo revealed severe global LV dysfunction (EF 13%), dilated LV, and moderate MR. Patient transferred to CICU for management of acute decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock.

Despite diuresis and inotropes, he developed worsening renal function and persistent hypotension. On hospital day 3, decision made to place a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for temporary circulatory support. Patient stabilized hemodynamically after device placement. Course complicated by transient AKI, anemia, and mild transaminitis.

### IMAGING  
- **CXR (4/27/24):** Bilateral pulmonary edema, enlarged cardiac silhouette, small right pleural effusion  
- **Echo (4/28/24):** Severe global LV systolic dysfunction, EF ~13%, moderate MR, RV systolic function mildly reduced  
- **CT Sinuses (prior):** Mucosal thickening, compatible with chronic sinusitis

---

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN  

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to acute decompensated heart failure (new diagnosis):**  
- Required vasopressors/inotropes, Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support  
- Weaned off inotropes/pressors, Impella removed HD #7  
- Continue GDMT for HF (initiate beta-blocker/ACEi as tolerated)  
- Cardiac rehab consult, low Na diet, daily weights  
- Serial ECHOs to monitor function  
- Cardiac MRI pending for etiology

**2. Volume Overload/Acute Pulmonary Edema:**  
- IV furosemide, net negative ~12L  
- Monitor electrolytes/renal function  
- Fluid restrict, strict I/O

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved):**  
- Likely pre-renal from hypoperfusion  
- Improved with device support, avoid nephrotoxins  
- Monitor for recurrence

**4. Anemia (multifactorial):**  
- Likely dilutional + chronic disease  
- Transfused 1U PRBC for Hgb <9  
- Monitor, iron studies pending

**5. Severe Obesity (BMI 41):**  
- Nutrition consult, low calorie/carb diet  
- Encourage early mobilization as tolerated

**6. Prediabetes:**  
- Monitor BG, A1c 5.9%  
- Diabetic diet, f/u with endocrinology

**7. Recurrent Upper Respiratory Infections (sinusitis, bronchitis):**  
- Treated with Augmentin for acute bronchitis  
- Symptomatic therapy for sinusitis  
- ENT referral for chronic symptoms

**8. DVT Prophylaxis:**  
- Heparin SQ

**9. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis:**  
- Pantoprazole IV

**10. Disposition:**  
- Remains in CICU, extubated, hemodynamically stable  
- Plan transfer to step-down when stable off all pressors/support  
- Multidisciplinary discharge planning

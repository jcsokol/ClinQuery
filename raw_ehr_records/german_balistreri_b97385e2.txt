**Epic EHR – Inpatient Progress Note**

**Patient:** German Balistreri  
**MRN:** 00918374  
**Date of Birth:** 04/27/1956  
**Sex:** Male  
**Admit Date:** 05/11/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. K. Davidson  
**Location:** MICU, Bed 8  
**Consults:** Cardiology, Infectious Disease, General Surgery

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.

---

## HOSPITAL COURSE (SUMMARY)

Mr. Balistreri is a 68-year-old male with a history notable for recurrent rectal polyps, chronic anemia, osteoarthritis of the knee, osteoporosis, recurrent cystitis, and recent acute bronchitis, who presented with 1 week of worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and increasing bilateral lower extremity swelling. He was initially admitted to the floor, but decompensated on hospital day 2 with hypotension and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring transfer to the MICU.

On arrival to the ICU, he was hypotensive (SBP 82 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 117), and hypoxic (SpO2 88% on 4L NC). Bedside TTE demonstrated severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, and moderate MR. Troponin peaked at 2.1 ng/mL. He was started on norepinephrine and dobutamine. Given persistent cardiogenic shock (SCAI C) refractory to medical therapy, a decision was made to place a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for temporary circulatory support on HD 3.

He stabilized hemodynamically, required diuresis, and was successfully weaned off vasopressors. Over the following days, his renal function improved, and he was transitioned to oral HF guideline-directed medical therapy. The Impella device was explanted on HD 8. He remains intermittently febrile, currently being worked up for possible device-related infection.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to decompensated HFrEF**  
- Impella CP placed for refractory shock, now explanted  
- Guideline-directed medical therapy for HF (carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone initiated)  
- On diuresis, euvolemic  
- Monitor for recurrent decompensation  
- Daily weights, strict I&O

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, cardiorenal)**  
- Improved with hemodynamic stabilization  
- Monitor renal function, adjust meds for renal dosing  
- Avoid nephrotoxins

**3. Chronic Anemia**  
- Multifactorial (chronic disease, GI blood loss)  
- Monitored, Hgb improving, no transfusion required  
- Iron studies, GI follow-up outpatient

**4. Device-related infection risk**  
- Intermittent fever, currently being evaluated  
- Blood cultures pending  
- Empiric vancomycin/cefepime started  
- Remove lines ASAP

**5. Osteoarthritis/Osteoporosis**  
- Continue alendronate  
- Pain managed with acetaminophen as needed  
- Ortho consult for mobility planning

**6. Recurrent cystitis**  
- Treated with nitrofurantoin  
- Monitor for complications

**7. Colon polyps, GI follow-up**  
- Due for interval colonoscopy (outpatient)

**8. Hyperlipidemia**  
- Continue statin therapy

**9. DVT prophylaxis**  
- SCDs, subQ heparin

**10. Disposition**  
- Anticipate transfer to step-down in 1-2 days  
- PT/OT to assess for safe discharge home vs short-term rehab

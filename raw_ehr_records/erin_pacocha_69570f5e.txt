### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Progressive shortness of breath, chest pressure, and orthopnea x3 days.  

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
31-year-old G2P1 female with h/o normal pregnancy (currently 34w), chronic anemia, atopic dermatitis, and recent acute bronchitis, presenting with 3 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. She was seen in the ED 2 days prior for cough and mild hypoxia, attributed to bronchitis; treated with supportive care and discharged. Today, found at home tachypneic and diaphoretic, O2 sat 87% RA, and was brought in by EMS. On arrival: BP 88/52, HR 128, RR 32, O2 sat 91% on 4L NC. Exam: JVD, bilateral rales, S3, 2+ pitting edema. CXR: pulmonary edema. Echo: severe global LV systolic dysfunction (EF 18%), mild RV dysfunction, no significant valvulopathy. Troponin mildly elevated.  

She decompensated on the floor with hypotension refractory to fluids, requiring transfer to MICU, initiation of norepinephrine and dobutamine, and ultimately placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock.

## HOSPITAL COURSE  
- Admitted for acute decompensated heart failure (likely peripartum cardiomyopathy vs. viral myocarditis), rapidly progressive, complicated by cardiogenic shock.
- Required norepinephrine and dobutamine infusions.
- Impella CP device placed on hospital day 2 for hemodynamic support.
- Spontaneous preterm labor on hospital day 4; urgent C-section at bedside with maternal stabilization, delivered viable male infant (NICU).  
- Complicated by AKI (pre-renal, resolved), mild transaminitis, and persistent anemia (transfused x1).  
- Dermatology consulted for eczema flare, treated with topical steroids.  
- Weaning of inotropes and device explantation on day 8 after cardiac recovery (EF improved to ~39%).  
- Now on low-dose beta-blocker and diuretic, transitioned to telemetry floor.  
- Multidisciplinary discharge planning in process.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute decompensated heart failure (presumed peripartum cardiomyopathy)**  
- Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support (HD 2–8).  
- Weaned off inotropes, device explanted after EF recovery.  
- Now on metoprolol succinate 12.5 mg QD, furosemide 20 mg BID.  
- Daily weights, strict I/O, telemetry.  
- Cardiology f/u.  
- Plan: continue uptitrating HF meds as tolerated, consider ACEi postpartum.

**2. Pregnancy (now postpartum, G2P2, 34 weeks at delivery)**  
- Preterm labor, urgent C-section HD 4.  
- Infant to NICU, stable.  
- OB following; lactation support.  
- Contraception counseling prior to discharge.

**3. Anemia**  
- Baseline iron deficiency, worsened during admission (Hgb nadir 9.6).  
- 1 unit PRBC transfused HD 4.  
- Continue supplemental iron, B12 IM.  
- Recheck CBC prior to discharge.

**4. AKI (resolved)**  
- Likely pre-renal from hypoperfusion, Cr peaked 1.7, now 0.6.  
- Monitored, resolved with improved CO and diuresis.  
- Renal f/u if rebound.

**5. Eczema / Contact Dermatitis**  
- Flare during admission, 30% BSA, no superinfection.  
- Managed with topical hydrocortisone, cetirizine for pruritus.  
- Dermatology f/u.

**6. Recent Acute Bronchitis**  
- No longer febrile, cough improved.  
- No infiltrate on CXR, no antibiotics required.  
- Monitor for secondary infection.

**7. Thromboembolism Prophylaxis**  
- SCDs while bleeding risk, transitioned to enoxaparin 40 mg SQ daily postpartum.

**8. Psychosocial / Disposition**  
- Significant stress, counseling offered.

**Patient Name:** Monte McClure  
**MRN:** 00429182  
**DOB:** 07/11/1975 (Age 48)  
**Sex:** Male  
**Admission Date:** 04/18/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. S. Malhotra  
**Admitting Diagnosis:** Acute decompensated heart failure, cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury  
**ICU Service:** Cardiology Critical Care  
**History of Present Illness:**  
48-year-old male with history of T2DM, CKD1, metabolic syndrome, chronic sinusitis, and hypertriglyceridemia, who presented with 3 days of worsening orthopnea, LE edema, and fatigue. On arrival, he was found to be hypotensive (SBP 74), tachycardic, and hypoxic on room air. CXR: pulmonary edema and mild cardiomegaly. Echo: severely reduced LVEF (15%), global hypokinesis, mild MR. Despite diuresis and inotropes, patient remained hypotensive with rising lactate and worsening renal function. Emergent left-sided Impella CP placed on HD2 for cardiogenic shock.

## Assessment & Plan

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated HF (EF 15%)
- Presentation: Hypotension, cold/clammy, lactic acidosis, end-organ hypoperfusion (oliguria, confusion).
- Interventions:
    - Impella CP placed HD2, ongoing support, flows 3.2 L/min, no hemolysis.
    - Inotropes (milrinone, weaned by HD6); vasopressors (norepinephrine, weaned by HD5).
    - IV diuresis (furosemide gtt â†’ bolus), net negative 4.8L HD1-5.
    - Daily echo: no tamponade, cannula position stable.
    - Cardiology/CT surgery: not a candidate for durable LVAD or transplant at this time.
    - Plan: Wean Impella if tolerated, monitor for arrhythmias, strict I/O, daily weights, telemetry.
    - Goal-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF as tolerated.
    - Serial lactate, pro-BNP, troponin trends.
    - Cardiac rehab consult.

### 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
- Home regimen: 70/30 insulin, poorly controlled.
- Admission: BGs 140-340, started insulin gtt in ICU, transitioned to basal/bolus by HD4.
- A1c 9.1% on admission.
- Plan: Endocrine consult, continue basal/bolus, sliding scale, monitor for hypoglycemia (esp. with AKI).

### 3. CKD1, now with AKI
- Admission Cr: 2.3 (baseline 1.1), BUN 36, GFR 38.
- Oliguria on HD1-3, improved with diuresis and Impella support.
- Renal US: no obstruction.
- Plan: Renal consult, monitor daily lytes/Cr, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal function.

### 4. Metabolic Syndrome / Hypertriglyceridemia
- Home: diet nonadherent, LDL 134, TG 166.
- Plan: statin continued, fenofibrate held (AKI), dietician consult, recheck lipids prior to DC.

### 5. Chronic Sinusitis / Viral URI
- Symptoms: mild nasal congestion, improved with abx (Augmentin) and antihistamines. No fever.
- Plan: Continue current course, ENT f/u after DC.

### 6. Hospital-acquired Infection Risk
- Central and arterial lines, Impella access, Foley HD1-5.
- Plan: Remove lines ASAP, daily line checks, monitor for fever/leukocytosis, blood cx if febrile.

### 7. Volume Overload / Pulmonary Edema
- Managed with aggressive IV diuresis, net negative fluid balance.
- Daily CXR to monitor pulmonary congestion.
- Plan: Continue diuresis as tolerated, monitor electrolytes.

### 8. Anemia of Chronic Disease
- Hgb dropped from 14.1 to 10.9 HD3, likely dilutional + hemodilution from device.
- No overt bleeding.
- Plan: Monitor, transfuse if <8 or symptomatic.

### 9. Electrolyte Abnormalities
- Hypokalemia (K nadir 3.2 HD2), hypomagnesemia (Mg 1.3 HD2).
- Repleted IV.
- Plan: Daily BMP, replace as needed.

### 10. Pain Management
- Mild chest/shoulder pain post-Impella.
- Plan: Tylenol prn, avoid NSAIDs (AKI), ice packs.

### 11. Social Issues
- Lives alone, recent job loss.
- Plan: Social work consult, consider SNF for rehab.

**EPIC EHR - INPATIENT PROGRESS NOTE**  
**Patient Name:** Rochel Willms  
**MRN:** 00248710  
**DOB:** 12/25/1986  
**Sex:** Female  
**Admit Date:** 05/11/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. Charles F. Morales  
**Service:** Cardiology/ICU  
**Note Date:** 05/15/2024  
**Author:** R. Singh, MD

**Chief Complaint:**  
Altered mental status, severe dyspnea, and chest pain.  

---

**History of Present Illness:**  
Rochel Willms is a 37-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and recent pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia, who presented to the ED with progressive shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and confusion. She was 2 weeks postpartum from a normal pregnancy, complicated by gestational hypertension and preeclampsia managed with labetalol and magnesium sulfate. In the ED, she was found to be hypoxic (SpO2 88% on RA), tachypneic (RR 32), tachycardic (HR 126), and hypertensive (BP 178/99). EKG showed sinus tachycardia, CXR with pulmonary edema, and initial troponin 0.21 (ref <0.04). Bedside echo revealed severely reduced LVEF (~20%), global hypokinesis, and moderate mitral regurgitation. She was transferred to the ICU for management of acute decompensated heart failure, likely secondary to peripartum cardiomyopathy, and ultimately required placement of a left-sided Impella CP device due to refractory cardiogenic shock despite maximal medical therapy.

- **Day 2:** Impella CP placed via left femoral artery for mechanical circulatory support.  
- **Day 3:** Gradual improvement in end-organ perfusion, decreased vasopressor requirements.  
- **Day 4:** Weaning Impella support, diuresis ongoing, off BiPAP, extubated.  
- **Complications:** Transient AKI (resolved), mild hemolysis (LDH peaked at 512, haptoglobin low), no arrhythmias.

# **Assessment & Plan**

**1. Acute decompensated heart failure (new onset, postpartum/peripartum cardiomyopathy)**
   - LVEF 20% on TTE, global hypokinesis, moderate MR  
   - Required temporary mechanical support (Impella) for cardiogenic shock  
   - Now weaning support, improving hemodynamics  
   - Plan: Continue gentle diuresis, monitor volume status, daily TTE, wean Impella as tolerated, initiate guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF as BP allows (beta-blocker, ACEi/ARB/ARNI, MRA), sodium restriction, DVT ppx

**2. Cardiogenic Shock**
   - Impella placed on ICU Day 2, now on minimal vasopressors  
   - Monitoring for device-related complications (hemolysis, limb ischemia, infection)  
   - Serial labs for hemolysis, LDH, haptoglobin, free Hgb  
   - Plan: Remove Impella when stable >24h off vasopressors, monitor for rebound shock

**3. Recent pregnancy/preeclampsia**
   - Delivered 2 weeks prior, recent gestational HTN/preeclampsia  
   - Monitor for eclampsia, HELLP, ongoing BP control  
   - Plan: Continue magnesium if seizure risk, monitor LFTs/platelets

**4. Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2)**
   - A1c 6.6%, glucose variable in ICU (90–180 mg/dL)  
   - On sliding scale insulin, hold oral agents  
   - Plan: Resume metformin if renal fxn stable, continue fingerstick glucose

**5. Hypertension**
   - Difficult to control, now improved with diuresis  
   - Plan: Restart home antihypertensives as tolerated, monitor BP closely

**6. Hypertriglyceridemia**
   - Triglycerides 188 mg/dL on admission  
   - Plan: Restart statin/fibrate when stable, dietary counseling

**7. AKI (resolved)**
   - Likely secondary to low cardiac output, improved with support  
   - Creatinine peaked at 1.5, now 0.9  
   - Plan: Monitor UOP, renal panel daily

**8. Volume overload**
   - Ongoing diuresis, net negative ~3L since admission  
   - Plan: Continue IV furosemide, monitor lytes

**9. Anemia of critical illness**
   - Hgb nadir 8.9 g/dL, now stable  
   - No overt bleeding  
   - Plan: Monitor CBC, transfuse PRN

**10. Contraception management**
   - On multiple hormonal agents, reevaluate given cardiac dx  
   - Plan: Consult OB for recommendations

**11. DVT prophylaxis**
   - On subq heparin, SCDs  
   - Plan: Continue

**12. Psychosocial support**
   - New diagnosis, postpartum, high stress  
   - Plan: Social work, psych consult

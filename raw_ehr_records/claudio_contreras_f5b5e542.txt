Epic EHR - Progress Note
---------------------------------------------------
Patient Name: Claudio Contreras        MRN: 002489166
DOB: 10/17/1912 (Age: 111)             Sex: Male
Date of Admission: 04/02/2024
Attending: Dr. R. Gentry
ICU Service: Cardiac ICU
---------------------------------------------------

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Claudio Contreras is a 111-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obesity, osteoarthritis of the hip, prediabetes, chronic anemia, prostate neoplasm (on leuprolide and docetaxel), osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s dementia, and chronic sinusitis, who presented to the ED from his skilled nursing facility for acute-on-chronic decompensated heart failure. He had a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath, orthopnea, and new onset confusion per caregivers. He was mildly hypoxic on arrival (SpO2 89% RA), with tachypnea and bibasilar rales. He was noted to have new hypotension and rising creatinine. Initial troponin was elevated. EKG showed new LBBB. Bedside echo revealed severely reduced LVEF (~10%) with global hypokinesis, moderate MR, and RV dysfunction. Cardiogenic shock was suspected, and he was transferred to the CICU where he was started on dobutamine and norepinephrine. Due to persistent shock, an Impella CP device (percutaneous LVAD) was placed for temporary mechanical circulatory support.

**Hospital Course Summary:**  
- Required intubation on HD#1 for hypoxic respiratory failure.
- Impella device placed on HD#2 for refractory cardiogenic shock.
- Complicated by AKI, anemia requiring transfusion, delirium, and transient VT.
- Weaned off device on HD#7, extubated HD#8, transitioned to comfort care after family meeting due to advanced dementia and poor prognosis.
- Discharged to SNF on HD#11.

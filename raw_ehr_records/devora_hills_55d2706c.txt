EpicCare Inpatient - Progress Note
Patient: Devora Hills      MRN: 0094721
DOB: 05/12/1972            Age: 51
Sex: Female                Attending: Dr. R. Zadeh
Date: 03/24/2024           Author: Dr. John Siegel, MD
Location: CVICU Rm 12      Admission Date: 03/18/2024

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and LE edema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
51-year-old obese prediabetic female with h/o anemia, hyperlipidemia, and multiple recent viral URIs, presented to the ED with acute onset dyspnea, chest heaviness, and palpitations. She reported 2 weeks of worsening exercise tolerance, sleeping upright, and 3-pillow orthopnea. On arrival, she was tachycardic, hypoxic, and mildly hypotensive. CXR showed pulmonary congestion. Troponin I was elevated. Echo revealed severe global LV dysfunction (EF ~15%), moderate MR, and moderate RV dysfunction. She rapidly decompensated in the ED, requiring BiPAP and escalating vasopressors. Cardiogenic shock was diagnosed. The patient was transferred to the CVICU, where a temporary percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) was placed for hemodynamic support.

HOSPITAL COURSE (ICU DAYS 1-7):
- Day 1: Admitted to CVICU, on norepinephrine + dobutamine. Impella placed via R femoral artery. Initial improvement in MAP and urine output.
- Day 2: Weaned off norepinephrine, remained on low-dose dobutamine. Lactate normalized. Serial CBC/Chem7 monitored.
- Day 3: Developed fever (38.6Â°C), started empiric vancomycin/cefepime; blood cx negative.
- Day 4: Mild GI bleeding (melena), Hgb dropped from 11.7 to 9.2. GI consulted; EGD showed mild gastritis, no active bleed.
- Day 5: Impella settings reduced, LV function reassessed by TTE (EF up to 25%). Renal function improved.
- Day 6: Impella weaned and removed at bedside. No vascular complications.
- Day 7: Transitioned to oral HF regimen (metoprolol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone), ambulating in room, transferred to stepdown.

PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN:

1. **Cardiogenic Shock, New Onset Severe Non-ischemic Cardiomyopathy**
   - Impella CP inserted for temporary LV support, now explanted
   - Etiology: likely viral myocarditis vs. idiopathic
   - Guideline-directed HF therapy initiated (BB, ARNI, MRA)
   - Cardiac MRI pending outpatient
   - Cardiology f/u, consider ICD if EF <35% in 90 days

2. **Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, multifactorial)**
   - Initial Cr 2.7, improved to 1.05 with volume/pressors/Impella
   - Monitor daily BMP
   - Avoid nephrotoxins

3. **Anemia (multifactorial)**
   - Baseline Hgb ~12, dropped to nadir 9.2 (GI loss vs. dilutional)
   - GI consulted, EGD: mild gastritis, no active bleed
   - Iron studies pending, monitor CBC

4. **Obesity, BMI 30+**
   - Dietician consult
   - Encourage ambulation, low sodium diet

5. **Prediabetes (A1c 6.4%)**
   - Monitor BG, no insulin needed
   - F/u with PCP, DM prevention counseling

6. **Hyperlipidemia**
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Lipid panel rechecked on discharge

7. **Recent viral URIs, possible myocarditis trigger**
   - No further signs of infection, afebrile x3 days
   - Blood cultures negative

8. **Contraceptive Management**
   - Mirena IUD in place, no changes
   - Discontinue oral progestins if not indicated

9. **DVT Prophylaxis**
   - SCDs, SQ heparin

10. **Other**
    - Multivitamin, FeSO4, PPI (for GI protection)
    - PT/OT evaluation for discharge planning

DISCHARGE PLANNING:
- Anticipate transfer to telemetry/stepdown today, then home with home health
- Close f/u with HF clinic, PCP, and Cardiology
- Echo in 4 weeks, cardiac MRI outpatient

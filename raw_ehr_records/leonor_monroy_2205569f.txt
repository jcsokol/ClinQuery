# History of Present Illness

46-year-old female with PMH significant for seizure disorder (on clonazepam), remote history of single seizure, chronic pain (foot laceration, prior wrist fracture/subluxation), and recurrent viral respiratory infections (acute viral pharyngitis x2, viral sinusitis, bronchitis), who presented to ED with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity swelling. She reports a viral URI 2 weeks prior. Family called EMS after she was found lethargic and tachypneic at home.

On arrival: HR 122, BP 85/60, RR 28, O2 sat 89% on RA, T 37.2°C, cool extremities, JVD present, bibasilar crackles, 2+ pitting edema to knees, S3 gallop. CXR: Pulmonary edema. Labs: Elevated troponin, BNP 2780, creatinine 2.1 (baseline 0.8), lactate 4.8. Echo: EF 15%, severe global hypokinesis, no LV thrombus.

She rapidly deteriorated with worsening hypotension and altered mental status, requiring intubation and vasopressors, and was transferred to the MICU. Due to ongoing cardiogenic shock refractory to maximal medical therapy, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 1.

# Hospital Course Summary

- **HD 1:** Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine. Impella CP placed via femoral approach. Started on heparin drip.
- **HD 2-4:** Gradual improvement in mentation and urine output. Weaned off norepinephrine by HD 3. Remained on dobutamine. Renal function improving.
- **HD 5:** Impella CP weaned and explanted. Extubated to HFNC, transitioned to oral heart failure regimen.
- **HD 6-7:** Mobilizing with PT/OT. Stable on oral medications. Discharged to home with close cardiology and neurology follow-up.

# Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

---

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure

- **Assessment:** 46F with new severe systolic dysfunction (EF 15%), likely viral myocarditis vs. idiopathic non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, presenting in shock.
- **Plan:**
  - Impella CP placed HD1, removed HD5
  - Initially required vasopressors/inotropes, now weaned
  - Diuresis with IV furosemide, transitioned to PO
  - Initiate guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone
  - Strict I/Os, daily weights
  - Cardiac MRI and outpatient heart failure clinic arranged
  - Anticoagulation for Impella, now D/C’d

## 2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

- **Assessment:** Likely pre-renal from shock, improved with volume and cardiac support
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor renal function, electrolytes
  - Avoid nephrotoxins
  - Renal dose adjustments as needed

## 3. Respiratory Failure

- **Assessment:** Intubated for hypoxia, pulmonary edema. Extubated HD5.
- **Plan:**
  - Pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry
  - Monitor for secondary infection

## 4. Seizure Disorder

- **Assessment:** No witnessed seizures this admission; on home clonazepam
- **Plan:**
  - Continue home clonazepam
  - EEG if any events
  - Neurology f/u

## 5. Pain Management/Chronic Injuries

- **Assessment:** History of wrist fracture, foot laceration
- **Plan:**
  - Continue acetaminophen/ibuprofen PRN
  - PT/OT for mobility

## 6. Viral Infections (Past)

- **Assessment:** No signs of active infection currently
- **Plan:** Monitor for infectious complications

## 7. Secondary Prevention

- **Plan:**
  - Aspirin 81 mg daily (secondary prevention)
  - Smoking cessation counseling (denies current tobacco)
  - Vaccinations up to date

## 8. Contraception

- **Assessment:** On Norinyl (combined OCP)
- **Plan:** Continue unless contraindicated

## 9. DVT Prophylaxis

- **Plan:** SCDs, ambulation. Heparin DVT ppx now resumed.

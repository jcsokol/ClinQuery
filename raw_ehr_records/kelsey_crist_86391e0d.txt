## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**Day 1:**  
Admitted to MICU for hypoxemia and hypotension. Initial labs notable for elevated troponin and BNP. EKG: sinus tachycardia, low voltage. CXR: mild pulmonary edema. Echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, mild MR. Started on dobutamine and low-dose Lasix.

**Day 2:**  
Worsening shock, MAP persistently <60 mmHg despite inotropes. Developed cool extremities, oliguria. Lactate 4.2. Decision made to place temporary left-sided Impella CP for cardiogenic shock. Cardiology and CT surgery at bedside for placement.

**Day 3-5:**  
Hemodynamics improved post-Impella. Urine output increased, lactate normalized. Repeat echo: LVEF up to 28%. Vascular access site with mild oozing, monitored. Mobilized to chair. Monitored for hemolysis, infection.

**Day 6:**  
Impella weaned and removed. Stable on low-dose milrinone. Transitioned to oral heart failure regimen. No arrhythmias.  

**Day 7-9:**  
Slow improvement. Tolerating oral nutrition. Ambulating with PT. Ready for transfer to step-down unit.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, likely viral myocarditis**
   - Placed on temporary Impella CP device for LV support due to refractory shock
   - Now weaned and explanted, hemodynamics stable
   - Continue HF regimen: low-dose carvedilol, lisinopril, Lasix PO
   - Monitor for arrhythmias, volume status, renal function

**2. Acute decompensated heart failure, new**
   - Etiology: likely viral (recent URI), non-ischemic
   - Diuresed with IV Lasix, transitioned to oral
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os

**3. Impella device management (removed)**
   - Site clean, no signs of infection/bleed
   - Monitor for hemolysis (LDH, haptoglobin), vascular complications

**4. AKI on CKD (resolved)**
   - Likely pre-renal, improved with pump support
   - Monitor for recurrence

**5. Recent acute bronchitis/pharyngitis**
   - Symptoms resolved
   - No antibiotics started

**6. Contraception counseling**
   - Continue Seasonique; review appropriateness given new cardiac dx

**7. Nutrition, Rehab, Discharge Planning**
   - PT/OT: progressing well
   - Social work: home support in place

**8. VTE Prophylaxis**
   - SCDs, transitioned to prophylactic enoxaparin

**9. Psychosocial**
   - Coping well, supportive family

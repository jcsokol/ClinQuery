### **History of Present Illness**

Suzy Wilkinson is a 28-year-old female with a PMH of hypertension, several remote upper respiratory infections, two prior normal pregnancies, and no known cardiac disease prior to this admission. She presented to the ED with a 2-day history of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema, initially attributed to a viral URI. Her symptoms rapidly progressed to acute hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension requiring intubation and vasopressors. Initial workup revealed cardiogenic shock with severely reduced LVEF (~15%) on bedside echo. Cardiology was consulted, and the patient was emergently transferred to the cardiac ICU. She subsequently required placement of a temporary left-sided heart pump (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

### **Hospital Course**

#### **Day 1 (03/12/24):**
- ED presentation with acute SOB, tachypnea, hypoxia (O2 sat 85% RA), tachycardia (HR 122), BP 88/52.
- Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
- Labs notable for elevated troponin (0.42 â†’ 1.08), BNP 3192, lactate 4.2, Cr 1.3 (baseline <1), LFTs mildly elevated.
- CXR: Pulmonary edema, bilateral infiltrates.
- Bedside Echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, LV dilation, RV mildly reduced.
- Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine.
- Admitted to CICU.

#### **Day 2:**
- Continued hemodynamic instability despite vasopressors/inotropes.
- Repeat echo: No improvement.
- Decision made for temporary mechanical circulatory support.
- Impella CP placed via femoral approach without complication.
- Rapid improvement in MAP, weaned off norepi.
- Foley, A-line, central line placed.
- Infectious w/u: Negative blood/urine cultures; viral panel positive for parainfluenza.

#### **Day 3-4:**
- Gradual diuresis with IV furosemide; 3L net negative.
- Extubated on day 4.
- Impella flows stable, no hemolysis.
- Renal function improved (Cr 1.0).
- LVEF on echo improved to 28% by day 4.
- Started on low-dose carvedilol, lisinopril for LV recovery.
- Monitored closely for arrhythmias (none noted).

#### **Day 5:**
- Weaned off inotropes; Impella CP removed at bedside.
- Echo: LVEF 35%, mild LV dilation.
- Mobilized to chair, started on cardiac rehab.
- Plan for GDMT titration.

#### **Day 6-7:**
- Stable on oral meds.
- Labs trending toward baseline.
- Discharge planning initiated.

### **Problem List & Assessment/Plan**

| Problem # | Problem/Diagnosis | Assessment & Plan |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock | Likely viral myocarditis (parainfluenza). Required temp MCS (Impella). Improving. Continue GDMT, monitor for arrhythmias, daily weights, fluid status. Cardiac rehab. |
| 2 | Hypoxic respiratory failure | Intubated, now extubated. O2 sat stable on RA. Pulm hygiene, incentive spirometry. |
| 3 | Acute kidney injury | Likely pre-renal from low CO, now resolved. Monitor Cr, avoid nephrotoxins. |
| 4 | Hypertension | Restarted antihypertensives (carvedilol, lisinopril). Monitor BP. |
| 5 | Electrolyte disturbances (K, Mg) | Repleted as needed, monitor daily. |
| 6 | Volume overload | Diuresed, now euvolemic. Monitor I/Os, daily weights. |
| 7 | Anemia | Hgb stable, no transfusions needed. Monitor CBC. |
| 8 | Anxiety | Patient/family education, reassurance. Social work consult. |
| 9 | Femoral access site | No hematoma/bleeding. Monitor site. |
| 10 | Contraception | On Seasonique. No issues. GYN aware. |

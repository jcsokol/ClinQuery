### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Wilbur Hettinger is a 66-year-old male with past medical history significant for non-small cell lung cancer (stage 1, on cisplatin/paclitaxel), chronic and viral sinusitis, seizure disorder (single prior event), prediabetes, and anemia. He was admitted from the oncology clinic after reporting two days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, increased fatigue, and intermittent chest discomfort. He became acutely hypoxic and hypotensive in the ED, requiring urgent transfer to the MICU.

On arrival to the ICU, Wilbur developed worsening respiratory distress and hypotension refractory to fluids and vasopressors. Bedside TTE demonstrated severe global LV dysfunction (EF ~15%), new compared to prior echo (EF 55% two months ago). Cardiology was consulted and the patient was emergently cannulated for percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) support for presumed cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to acute myocarditis vs. ischemic insult (possibly chemotherapy-associated). 

Course complicated by acute renal failure, anemia, and transaminitis. Oncology, nephrology, and infectious disease have been involved.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**66M with NSCLC, recent chemo, now acute cardiogenic shock requiring temporary LV assist device (Impella CP), AKI, and anemia.**

**Active Problems:**

1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Acute LV Failure**  
   - Presumed secondary to chemo-induced myocarditis vs. ischemic insult  
   - Required Impella CP, now decannulated, improving EF  
   - Plan: Daily TTE, telemetry, continue goal-directed medical therapy, avoid further cardiotoxins

2. **Acute Kidney Injury (Stage 3, multifactorial)**  
   - Likely pre-renal (shock), nephrotoxic meds  
   - Plan: Renal dose adjustments, nephrology f/u, monitor UOP, trending Cr, strict I/Os

3. **Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage 1, RUL)**  
   - On cisplatin/paclitaxel, held for now  
   - Plan: Resume pending cardiac stabilization, oncology f/u, consider alternative agents

4. **Anemia (likely chronic, worsened by AKI/critical illness)**  
   - Baseline Hgb ~11–12, nadir 10.3  
   - Plan: Monitor, transfuse if <8 or symptomatic, iron studies pending

5. **Transaminitis**  
   - Mild, likely shock liver, resolving  
   - Plan: Monitor LFTs, avoid hepatotoxins

6. **Seizure Disorder**  
   - No new seizures, mild confusion likely metabolic  
   - Plan: Continue seizure precautions, neurology prn

7. **Infection Risk, Immunocompromised**  
   - No current evidence of infection; cultures negative  
   - Plan: D/C abx, monitor for new fevers, neutropenic precautions

8. **Prediabetes**  
   - HbA1c 6.1%, mild hyperglycemia during stress  
   - Plan: Monitor FS, sliding scale insulin prn

9. **Chronic Sinusitis/Bronchitis**  
   - No current URI sx  
   - Plan: Supportive, ENT prn

**Disposition:**  
- Continue ICU monitoring, anticipate step-down in 24–48h if stable  
- PT/OT eval prior to transfer  
- Cardiac rehab consult

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Ms. Doyle is a 42-year-old female with a complex medical history including HTN, DM2, metabolic syndrome X, hypertriglyceridemia, atopic dermatitis, and recent antepartum eclampsia (delivered 4 weeks prior at OSH), who presented with acute onset SOB, chest pain, confusion, and hypotension. She was found to have severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF 15%), pulmonary edema, and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. She was transferred to the MICU for escalating inotropic and vasopressor support. Despite initial therapy, she deteriorated and required placement of an Impella CP for temporary mechanical circulatory support.

Her hospital course was further complicated by AKI (pre-renal, resolved), hyperglycemia, and a traumatic right thigh laceration and left rib fracture after a syncopal fall at home. She also had a history of mild persistent atopic dermatitis, controlled on topical steroids and cyclosporine.

### PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

#### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Severe LV Dysfunction (EF 15%), Postpartum**
- **Assessment:** Decompensated heart failure with evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion, 4 weeks postpartum, multifactorial etiology (peripartum cardiomyopathy vs. ischemic). Required Impella CP for circulatory support x 4 days.
- **Plan:**  
    - Continue weaning off inotropes and Impella support (removal planned tomorrow).  
    - Daily TTEs, strict I/O, monitor for arrhythmias.  
    - Initiate guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF as tolerated.  
    - Cardiology to follow.  
    - Transition to oral diuretics as renal function improves.  
    - Anticoagulation per device protocol.

#### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury, Resolved**
- **Assessment:** Likely secondary to low cardiac output, improved with volume optimization and improved perfusion.
- **Plan:**  
    - Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins.  
    - Adjust med dosing as needed.  
    - Nephrology available PRN.

#### 3. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Poorly Controlled**
- **Assessment:** HgbA1c 7.1%, glucose fluctuating with stress and infection.
- **Plan:**  
    - Continue basal-bolus insulin regimen.  
    - Endocrine consult for optimization.  
    - Dietary counseling, monitor for hypoglycemia.

#### 4. **Hypertension / Metabolic Syndrome / Hypertriglyceridemia**
- **Assessment:** Longstanding; exacerbated by pregnancy and heart failure.
- **Plan:**  
    - Continue antihypertensives.  
    - Lipid panel to be repeated prior to discharge.  
    - Consider statin after acute event.  
    - Lifestyle counseling.

#### 5. **Recent Antepartum Eclampsia / Normal Pregnancy (Delivered 4 weeks prior)**
- **Assessment:** No signs of ongoing preeclampsia/eclampsia. OB/maternal-fetal medicine following.
- **Plan:**  
    - Monitor BP, neuro status.  
    - Contraceptive counseling (multiple devices in situ; see GYN note).  
    - Routine postpartum follow-up.

#### 6. **Traumatic Laceration (Right Thigh) & Left Rib Fracture**
- **Assessment:** Sustained in syncopal fall. No evidence of deep tissue infection; healing well.
- **Plan:**  
    - Wound care and daily dressing changes.  
    - Pain management (acetaminophen, avoid NSAIDs).  
    - Rib fracture: incentive spirometry, pain control, mobilization.

#### 7. **Atopic Dermatitis**
- **Assessment:** Flare during hospitalization, likely stress-related.
- **Plan:**  
    - Continue topical steroids, cyclosporine.  
    - Dermatology PRN.

#### 8. **Medication Reconciliation / Drug Safety**
- **Assessment:** Multiple home meds, some duplicative contraceptives.
- **Plan:**  
    - Review with pharmacy.  
    - Hold NSAIDs due to GI bleed risk.  
    - Ensure up-to-date allergy and med list before discharge.

#### 9. **Other Issues**
- **Nutrition:** On cardiac diet; encourage PO intake as tolerated.
- **Mobility:** PT/OT evaluation for post-ICU weakness.
- **Psychosocial:** Social work consult for home support, postpartum resources.
- **DVT Prophylaxis:** SCDs, heparin when Impella removed.

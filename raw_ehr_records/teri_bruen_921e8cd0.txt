# ICU HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**ICU Day 1-2:**  
Presented in florid cardiogenic shock, requiring norepinephrine, dobutamine. Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Cardiac markers elevated (troponin I 2.1 ng/mL, BNP 8900 pg/mL). Echo: global hypokinesis, severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF <15%). Infectious workup notable for positive parainfluenza PCR; negative for COVID, RSV, influenza. Started empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone, doxycycline), discontinued after viral etiology confirmed.

**ICU Day 2:**  
Progressive hypotension, rising lactate (4.8 mmol/L), oliguria. Impella CP placed via femoral approach for mechanical circulatory support. Hemodynamics improved, weaned off norepinephrine by day 3.  

**ICU Day 3-5:**  
Gradual improvement. Extubated on day 4. Renal function normalized, urine output improved. Serial echo: slow improvement in EF to 25%. Impella weaned, removed day 5.

**ICU Day 6-8:**  
Transferred to step-down. Diuresed for persistent pulmonary congestion. Mobilized with PT.  

**ICU Day 9:**  
Discharged home with close cardiology follow-up.

# ASSESSMENT & PLAN

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Fulminant Viral Myocarditis  
- Required temporary mechanical support (Impella CP).  
- Now off pressors, stable.  
- Echo: improving EF.  
- Plan: Continue guideline-directed medical therapy. Monitor for arrhythmia. Cardiac MRI as outpatient.

## 2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure  
- Intubated, now extubated.  
- Pulmonary congestion improved with diuresis.  
- Incentive spirometry, ambulation.

## 3. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)  
- Likely pre-renal, multifactorial (low CO, diuretics).  
- Renal function normalized. Monitor.

## 4. Parainfluenza Viral Infection  
- Supportive care only.  
- Antibiotics discontinued after negative bacterial workup.

## 5. History of Clavicle Fracture  
- No current issues.

## 6. Contraceptive Management  
- OCPs held during acute illness due to thrombosis risk.  
- Resume after discharge per Gyn.

## 7. Pain  
- Well controlled with PRN acetaminophen.

## 8. Nutrition  
- Mildly underweight.  
- Dietician to follow as outpatient.

## 9. DVT Prophylaxis  
- SCDs, SQ heparin during hospitalization.

## 10. Physical Therapy  
- Mobilization, safe for home.

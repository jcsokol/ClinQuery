### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Forrest Gleason is a 20-year-old male with a history of chronic sinusitis, recurrent otitis media, and a remote concussion, who presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and two episodes of syncope. He was initially seen by his PCP for presumed viral sinusitis and started on amoxicillin and acetaminophen. In the ED, he was tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic. Cardiac exam revealed an S3, JVD, and bibasilar crackles. CXR showed pulmonary edema. EKG: sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T changes. Troponin elevated. Echo: severely reduced LVEF (~15%), dilated LV, global hypokinesis. He was admitted to the CICU for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and cardiogenic shock.

Due to refractory hypotension and hypoperfusion despite maximal medical therapy (dobutamine, norepi, diuresis), Forrest required placement of a temporary left-sided ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 1 for circulatory support. He has since stabilized on support, with gradual improvement in end-organ function.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

#### 1. **Cardiogenic shock, new-onset severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy**
- Required Impella CP for hemodynamic support, now weaned off
- Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone, SGLT2i
- Monitor for arrhythmias, volume status, renal function
- Cardiac MRI pending for etiology (myocarditis vs. idiopathic)
- Family meeting for advanced HF planning

#### 2. **Acute kidney injury (pre-renal, secondary to hypoperfusion)**
- Improved with restoration of cardiac output
- Monitor daily labs, strict I/Os, avoid nephrotoxins

#### 3. **Transaminitis, likely congestive hepatopathy**
- Improving with volume management
- Monitor LFTs, trend down

#### 4. **Recurrent sinusitis, otitis media**
- Continue ENT follow-up
- Amoxicillin course to complete

#### 5. **Infection risk (ICU, invasive devices)**
- Blood cultures negative
- D/C empiric abx after 72h afebrile, negative cultures

#### 6. **Nutritional risk, cachexia**
- High-calorie, high-protein diet; consult nutrition
- Daily weight, monitor for refeeding

#### 7. **History of concussion**
- No new neuro deficits
- Monitor mentation

#### 8. **Dispo planning**
- Anticipate transfer to stepdown, then home with HF follow-up, PT/OT

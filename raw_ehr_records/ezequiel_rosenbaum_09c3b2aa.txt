# HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**Chief Complaint:**  
Acute onset chest pain, dyspnea, and syncope at home.

**History of Present Illness:**  
41-year-old male, previously healthy aside from recent streptococcal pharyngitis treated with penicillin, presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and pleuritic chest pain. He experienced a syncopal episode at home. On arrival, hypotensive (BP 78/52), tachycardic (HR 126), tachypneic (RR 28), hypoxic on room air (SpO2 87%). Initial workup notable for elevated troponin, diffuse ST elevations, and echocardiogram with severe global hypokinesis, EF 15%. He rapidly progressed to cardiogenic shock, requiring vasopressors and subsequently, insertion of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) in the ICU. Infectious workup negative except for positive rapid strep test and elevated anti-streptolysin O titers. Blood cultures negative.  

**Hospital Course:**  
- Admitted to ICU on day 0 for acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock.  
- Initiated on norepinephrine, switched to dobutamine for inotropy.  
- Impella CP placed on day 1 for refractory shock.  
- Developed acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) days 2-5.  
- Complicated by transient atrial fibrillation, managed with amiodarone.  
- Weaned off Impella on day 5 as cardiac function improved (repeat echo EF 32%).  
- Persistent low-grade fever, negative infectious workup, presumed inflammatory myocarditis.  
- Down-trended CRRT, renal function improved.  
- Transferred to step-down unit day 7.  
- Discharged home on day 9 with outpatient follow-up.

# ASSESSMENT & PLAN (Problem-Based)

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Acute Fulminant Myocarditis**  
- Rapid-onset global LV dysfunction with severe reduction in EF (15%).  
- Required vasopressors (norepinephrine, then dobutamine) and mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP).  
- Improved cardiac function post-support, now off inotropes/Impella.  
- Plan: Continue GDMT for heart failure (BB, ACEi), serial echos, outpatient cardiology. No device needed at discharge.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (Stage 3, multifactorial: hypotension, low cardiac output)**  
- Required CRRT days 2–5, renal function improving.  
- Plan: Strict I/Os, daily labs, renal dosing of meds, nephrology follow-up.

**3. Arrhythmia (Atrial Fibrillation with RVR)**  
- New-onset, likely secondary to critical illness, resolved with amiodarone.  
- Plan: Continue amiodarone, telemetry, consider taper if no recurrence.

**4. Recent Streptococcal Pharyngitis**  
- Treated with penicillin V, likely trigger for immune-mediated myocarditis.  
- Plan: Complete abx course, monitor ASO titers, no evidence of persistent infection.

**5. Volume Overload/CHF**  
- Managed with IV diuretics, improved with renal recovery.  
- Plan: Transition to oral diuretics, daily weights, home scale.

**6. Hyperlipidemia**  
- LDL 90 mg/dL, on statin.  
- Plan: Continue statin, dietary counseling.

**7. DVT Prophylaxis**  
- On heparin throughout ICU stay.  
- Plan: Continue until ambulatory.

**8. Pain**  
- Mild, managed with acetaminophen.  
- Plan: PRN non-opioid analgesia.

**9. Social/Disposition**  
- Lives alone, employed, family involved.  
- Plan: Discharge with home health, outpatient cardiac rehab, follow-up in HF clinic in 1 week.

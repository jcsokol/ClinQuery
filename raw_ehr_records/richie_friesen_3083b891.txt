**EPIC EHR NOTE**  
**Patient Name:** Richie Friesen  
**MRN:** 00875432  
**DOB:** 04/20/1962  
**Sex:** Male  
**Date of Admission:** 03/14/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. S. Karp  
**Admitting Diagnosis:** Cardiogenic shock secondary to acute decompensated heart failure (CHF), s/p temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) placement  
**Service:** Cardiac ICU

---

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Richie Friesen is a 61-year-old male with a complex history of hypertension, T2DM, CKD stage 1, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, anemia, and viral sinusitis, who presented to the ED with acute-on-chronic dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with hypotension refractory to medical management. He developed worsening hypoperfusion and was transferred to the ICU for cardiogenic shock, where he required placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (LVAD, Impella) for circulatory support.

---

**Problem List:**
1. Cardiogenic shock, acute on chronic HFrEF  
2. T2DM with neuropathy, suboptimally controlled  
3. CKD1, diabetic nephropathy  
4. Hypertension  
5. Hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia  
6. Anemia, likely chronic disease  
7. Viral sinusitis  
8. Metabolic syndrome  
9. Osteoarthritis, bilateral hands  
10. Pain (mild, chronic)

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

#### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, s/p Impella Placement**
- Presentation: Profound hypotension, cold extremities, oliguria, rising lactate. Echo: LVEF 18%, global hypokinesis.
- ICU course: Initiated dobutamine and norepinephrine, poor response, Impella CP placed on Day 2. Gradual improvement in end-organ perfusion.
- Monitoring: Serial lactate, mixed venous O2 sat, daily echo, strict I/Os.
- Plan:
  - Wean vasopressors as tolerated.
  - Daily TTE.
  - Continue Impella, reassess for explant vs. bridge to durable LVAD vs. transplant candidacy.
  - Anticoagulation per protocol.
  - Infectious prophylaxis (see #7).
  - Physical therapy consult for mobility.

#### 2. **T2DM with Neuropathy**
- Admission A1c: 8.1% (prior), insulin-dependent.
- Glucose lability during ICU stay (range 62–298 mg/dL).
- Plan:
  - Sliding scale regular insulin, reduce basal dose while NPO.
  - Endocrinology consulted for regimen optimization.
  - Monitor for hypoglycemia, especially with poor PO intake.
  - Neuropathy: Gabapentin resumed on Day 4.

#### 3. **CKD1, Diabetic Nephropathy**
- Baseline Cr 1.3, admission Cr up to 2.1 mg/dL (see table).
- U/O improved after Impella, no need for RRT.
- Plan:
  - Avoid nephrotoxins.
  - Renal dosing of all meds.
  - Daily BMP, monitor for hyperkalemia.

#### 4. **Hypertension**
- Hx of labile BP, on triple therapy (amlodipine/HCTZ/olmesartan).
- ICU: BP support required; home meds held.
- Plan:
  - Restart antihypertensives as tolerated after vasopressor wean.
  - Monitor orthostasis.

#### 5. **Hyperlipidemia, Hypertriglyceridemia**
- On simvastatin, unclear adherence.
- Admission lipids: TC 204, LDL 131, TG 151, HDL 42.
- Plan:
  - Resume statin when LFTs normalize.
  - Dietary counseling pending PO intake.

#### 6. **Anemia, Chronic Disease**
- Baseline Hgb 12.2, dropped to 8.4 on Day 3 (see Table 1; likely multifactorial: hemodilution, blood draws, device-related hemolysis).
- Plan:
  - Transfuse if Hgb <7.5 or symptomatic.
  - Monitor retic count, LDH, haptoglobin.
  - Iron studies pending.

#### 7. **Viral Sinusitis**
- Congestion, rhinorrhea on admission. No fever, negative procalcitonin.
- Plan:
  - Supportive care.
  - Monitor for superimposed bacterial infection.

#### 8. **Metabolic Syndrome**
- Addressed via management of above comorbidities.

#### 9. **Osteoarthritis, Hands**
- Chronic, managed with PRN naproxen (held in ICU due to AKI risk).

#### 10. **Pain, Mild**
- Numeric rating 2/10; no acute pain issues during stay.

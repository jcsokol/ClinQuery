### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**Day 1:**  
Admitted to the Cardiology ICU for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) with possible cardiogenic shock. Required norepinephrine and dobutamine drips for MAP support. Echo showed LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis. Cardiac cath: non-obstructive CAD, elevated filling pressures. Lactate 4.2, troponin mildly elevated.  

**Day 2:**  
Worsening end-organ perfusion (Cr up to 2.1, AST/ALT rising, cold extremities). Decision made for temporary left-sided percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) placement at bedside. Tolerated well, hemodynamics stabilized.  

**Day 3-4:**  
Gradual wean of vasopressors, improved renal perfusion, urine output increased. Monitored for hemolysis, device-related complications. Developed mild thrombocytopenia.  

**Day 5:**  
Weaned off inotropes, LVAD flows stable, extubated. Mild delirium, managed supportively.  

**Day 6-8:**  
Continued improvement, device weaning attempted. Repeat echo: LVEF improved to 32%. Device explanted on day 8.  

**Day 9-10:**  
Transferred to step-down. Monitored for recurrent decompensation, started on guideline-directed HF therapy (metoprolol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone).  

**Discharge Plan:**  
To rehab facility for continued PT/OT, close f/u in HF clinic.

### PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (ADHF, severe LV systolic dysfunction)**
   - Etiology: Likely viral myocarditis vs. idiopathic non-ischemic CM (no significant CAD)
   - Temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placed day 2, removed day 8
   - Vasopressors/inotropes: Norepi, dobutamine (weaned off by day 5)
   - Diuresis: IV furosemide, judicious fluid balance
   - Monitor for arrhythmia, device complications (hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, limb ischemia)
   - Repeat TTE post-device: LVEF improved to 32%
   - Plan: Continue GDMT for HF, close monitoring, cardiac rehab

**2. Prediabetes**
   - BG monitored, no hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia noted
   - A1c 6.3% on admission
   - Diet: ADA, encourage weight loss, f/u with PCP

**3. Chronic Anemia**
   - Hgb nadir 11.8, no transfusion required
   - Likely multifactorial (chronic disease, mild dilutional)
   - Monitor, iron panel pending outpatient

**4. Thrombocytopenia (new, mild)**
   - Platelets dropped to 144â€“154 K/uL with device
   - Likely device-related, trended up after removal
   - No evidence of HIT (neg PF4), no bleeding

**5. AKI (resolved)**
   - Cr increased to 2.1 with shock, improved to baseline post-support
   - Renal function at discharge: Cr 1.1

**6. Acute Delirium**
   - Developed post-extubation, resolved with reorientation, sleep hygiene

**7. Hyperlipidemia**
   - On statin, LDL at goal
   - Continue outpatient

**8. Remote ankle sprain, acute bronchitis, viral pharyngitis**
   - No active issues

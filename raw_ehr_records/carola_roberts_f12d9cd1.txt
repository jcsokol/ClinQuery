### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Shortness of breath, chest discomfort, hypotension

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carola Roberts is a 76-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, prediabetes, osteoporosis, and chronic anemia who presented to the ED with acute onset dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest tightness. She reported 3 days of worsening lower extremity edema and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She denied fever or cough. In the ED, she was found to be hypotensive (BP 84/62), tachycardic (HR 112), and hypoxic (SpO2 88% on RA). CXR showed pulmonary edema. Troponin was mildly elevated. She rapidly deteriorated with worsening hypoxia and shock requiring ICU transfer.

She was started on norepinephrine and furosemide. Echo revealed severe global LV dysfunction (EF 20%) with moderate MR, no tamponade, RV function preserved. Cardiology was consulted, and she was emergently placed on a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock. She was intubated for airway protection and oxygenation. She is now on day 7 of Impella support and has had gradual improvement in end organ perfusion and urine output. She remains in the MICU.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**76F with HTN, hypothyroidism, prediabetes, osteoporosis, chronic anemia, presenting with acute decompensated heart failure, cardiogenic shock, requiring temporary LVAD (Impella) and intubation. Improving but remains critically ill.**

---

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
- Likely ischemic or demand-related, possible underlying chronic cardiomyopathy.
- Placed on Impella CP 4/17 for refractory shock.
- Weaning pressors (now off norepinephrine x2 days).
- LV function slightly improved on bedside echo (EF ~28%).
- Plan: Continue Impella support, monitor hemodynamics. Daily TTE. Cardiology to reassess for explant vs. transition to durable device if no further recovery.

### 2. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
- Intubated for airway protection/O2ation.
- On low vent settings, FiO2 35%, PEEP 8.
- Plan: SATs daily, SBT tomorrow. Pulm to assess for extubation readiness.

### 3. **Volume Overload / Renal Dysfunction**
- Initial AKI (Cr 1.32 → 0.77). Now with improved urine output.
- Diuresis with furosemide gtt, goal net -500 mL/day.
- Monitor lytes, daily weights.

### 4. **Chronic Anemia**
- Hgb stable 11.1–12.9. No evidence of acute bleed.
- Multifactorial (CKD, chronic disease, osteoporosis Rx).
- Plan: Monitor, transfuse if <8 or symptomatic.

### 5. **Hypothyroidism**
- On levothyroxine. TSH 3.1, FT4 0.21 (low).
- Plan: Continue home dose, repeat TSH/FT4 q7d.

### 6. **Osteoporosis**
- On alendronate. High risk for fracture.
- Plan: Hold bisphosphonate while NPO. Vit D/Ca supplementation IV.

### 7. **Prediabetes**
- BG 89–113. No insulin needed.
- Monitor q6h while NPO.

### 8. **HTN**
- Off PO agents, BP low/normal.
- No IV antihypertensives needed.

### 9. **Infection Prophylaxis**
- No active infection. Blood/sputum cx neg.
- VAP, CLABSI, CAUTI prevention bundles in place.

### 10. **Delirium Prevention**
- Off sedation holidays daily.
- Family at bedside.

### 11. **DVT Prophylaxis**
- SCDs in place, SQ heparin BID.

### 12. **Nutrition**
- NPO for Impella, receiving tube feeds at goal rate.

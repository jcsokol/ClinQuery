[Chief Complaint]
Shortness of breath, weakness, chest tightness

[History of Present Illness]
44M with history of obesity and recent acute bronchitis, presented to ED with 4 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and non-productive cough. Patient reports progressive fatigue, inability to ambulate >20 feet, and 2-pillow orthopnea. Denies fever, chills, or leg swelling. He initially attributed symptoms to bronchitis but noted acute worsening overnight. In the ED, found tachypneic and hypoxic (O2 sat 87% RA). CXR: bilateral pulmonary edema. Troponin mildly elevated. Echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis. Admitted to ICU for acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock. Required dobutamine, norepinephrine, and subsequently placed on temporary Impella CP device for hemodynamic support.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
[ICU Course Summary]

Day 1: Admitted with cardiogenic shock, required norepinephrine and dobutamine. Worsening hypotension despite increasing vasopressors; bedside echo showed poor LVEF. Decision made for temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP) placement.

Day 2: Impella placed via right femoral artery, immediate improvement in MAP and end-organ perfusion. Weaned norepinephrine. Developed transient hematuria, self-resolved.

Day 3: Improved urine output, mental status clear. Still requiring moderate Impella support. Started low-dose IV Lasix.

Day 4: Vasopressors off, Impella flows reduced. Echo: LVEF 20%. Mild transaminitis noted, trending down.

Day 5: Weaned off Impella, device removed. Remained hemodynamically stable. Transitioned to oral heart failure therapies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
[Assessment & Plan]

1. **Cardiogenic shock, new systolic heart failure (LVEF 15%)**
   - Likely ischemic vs viral myocarditis (workup ongoing)
   - Required temporary Impella CP support, now off device; improving
   - Continue aggressive diuresis, titrate guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)
   - Serial Echos, daily weights, strict I/O
   - Monitor for arrhythmias, renal/hepatic dysfunction

2. **Acute bronchitis (recent)**
   - No current signs of infection, afebrile
   - No antibiotics indicated

3. **Obesity (BMI ~30)**
   - Counsel on diet/exercise once stable
   - Monitor for OSA

4. **Transaminitis (transient, likely hypoperfusion-related)**
   - Trending down, continue to monitor LFTs

5. **AKI, resolving**
   - Improved with restoration of perfusion
   - Monitor daily labs

6. **Hyperlipidemia**
   - Not on statin; initiate once stable

7. **Hypertension**
   - Off anti-HTN in ICU; to restart as tolerated

8. **Pain (mild)**
   - Acetaminophen PRN

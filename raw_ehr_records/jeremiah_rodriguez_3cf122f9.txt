# ICU ADMISSION NOTE

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema for 2 weeks. Presented to ED after syncopal episode at home.

---

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Jeremiah Rodriguez is a 110-year-old male with a past medical history significant for chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) with reduced ejection fraction (last known EF 43%), hypertension, obesity (BMI 30+), prediabetes, anemia, prostate neoplasm (carcinoma in situ), history of stroke, chronic sinusitis, and significant alcohol use. He presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral edema. Family reports decreased oral intake and confusion. In the ED, he had hypotension (SBP 78 mmHg), tachycardia, and hypoxia requiring 2L O2 via nasal cannula. Initial labs notable for elevated NT-proBNP, mild acute kidney injury, and anemia.

He was admitted to the ICU for cardiogenic shock secondary to acute-on-chronic decompensated heart failure. Due to persistent hypotension and end-organ hypoperfusion despite maximal medical therapy, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on HD2.

# PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute-on-Chronic Systolic CHF (EF 39%)
- Impella CP placed for refractory shock; improved perfusion.
- Now off pressors/inotropes, euvolemic.
- Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): beta-blocker, ACEi/ARB (consider if renal fxn stable), diuretics.
- Daily weights, strict I/O, monitor for arrhythmia.
- Cardiology f/u, echo planned.

## 2. Acute Kidney Injury (on CKD 3)
- Likely ischemic ATN, improved with restoration of perfusion and diuresis.
- Monitor renal panel BID.
- Avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for GFR.

## 3. Anemia (Hgb nadir 8.2, baseline ~13)
- Transfused 1U PRBCs HD4.
- No evidence of bleeding, likely multifactorial (chronic dz, dilutional, chemo).
- Monitor CBC qAM.

## 4. Hypertension
- Hold HCTZ during AKI, resume if BP stable and euvolemic.
- Continue metoprolol, titrate as tolerated.

## 5. Prostate CA (c/s, on leuprolide/docetaxel)
- Oncology f/u; no active issues during ICU stay.
- Continue leuprolide, hold chemo until stabilized.

## 6. Alcohol Use Disorder
- CIWA protocol on admission, no withdrawal.
- Social work consult; thiamine, folate supplementation.

## 7. Stroke (remote)
- Remains at baseline. No new focal deficits.
- Continue secondary prevention (statin, antiplatelet).

## 8. Sinusitis/Bronchitis
- Treated with amox/clav for 5 days (HD1–5), improved.
- No fevers, WBC normalized.

## 9. Prediabetes, Obesity
- Sliding scale insulin, monitor glucose.
- Nutrition consult, low-salt, cardiac diet.

## 10. DVT Prophylaxis
- SCDs, low-dose heparin SC.

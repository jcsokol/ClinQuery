### ADMISSION SUMMARY

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, chest discomfort, and orthopnea x2 weeks.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
21-year-old male with past medical history of obesity (BMI 36.6), recent viral sinusitis and pharyngitis, and multiple episodes of acute bronchitis, presented to the ED with 5 days of worsening dyspnea, low-grade fevers, and new-onset lower extremity edema. He reported a dry cough and mild chest pain that worsened with exertion. Denied illicit drug use. No prior cardiac history. On arrival, found to be tachycardic (HR 122), BP 98/56, O2 sat 92% on room air.

Within 12 hours, he developed hypotension (SBP 80s), hypoxemia, and progressive respiratory distress requiring transfer to ICU and intubation. TTE showed severe global LV dysfunction (EF ~15%), RV mildly reduced, no significant valvular disease. Troponin mildly elevated. Cardiac index <2.0 L/min/m2 on Swan-Ganz. Given concern for fulminant myocarditis, patient underwent urgent placement of a percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (likely fulminant viral myocarditis) - s/p Impella CP placement**  
- Initial presentation with acute decompensated heart failure and shock  
- Rapid initiation of mechanical circulatory support (Impella)  
- Hemodynamics stabilized, LV function improved  
- Plan: Continue GDMT (guideline-directed medical therapy), monitor for arrhythmias, serial Echos, close follow-up with advanced heart failure

**2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - s/p intubation, now extubated**  
- Likely secondary to pulmonary edema and low output heart failure  
- Weaned off ventilator, now on nasal cannula  
- Plan: Monitor O2, chest PT, incentive spirometry

**3. Obesity (BMI 36.6)**  
- Risk factor for poor outcomes  
- Dietary consult, PT/OT, discussed weight management

**4. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, resolved)**  
- Likely secondary to low cardiac output and diuresis  
- Now improved, Cr trending down  
- Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins

**5. Transaminitis / Shock Liver (resolved)**  
- Mild LFT elevation, now improving  
- Plan: Monitor LFTs, supportive care

**6. Past Infections (sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis media)**  
- No evidence of ongoing infection  
- Completed abx courses  
- Plan: No further antibiotics

**7. Pain (mild, 3/10)**  
- Likely post-procedural  
- Managed with acetaminophen  
- Plan: Continue PRN, avoid NSAIDs due to renal risk

**8. Psychosocial**  
- Young patient, new diagnosis, significant stress  
- SW and Chaplain involved  
- Plan: Continue support, consider psych consult if needed

---

**Discharge Planning:**  
- Anticipate transfer to telemetry step-down 3/24  
- Close f/u with advanced HF, cardiology, PCP  
- Echo in 2 weeks, labs in 1 week  
- Return precautions reviewed

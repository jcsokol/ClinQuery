**HPI:**  
Mr. Giuseppe Moen is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (s/p PCI 2018), prediabetes, anemia, and remote concussion who presented to the ED with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest pressure. He had a recent URI/bronchitis treated with azithromycin as an outpatient. In the ED, he was found to be hypotensive (SBP 72 mmHg), tachycardic, hypoxic, and in respiratory distress. EKG showed diffuse ST depressions; troponin T was elevated at 1.5 ng/mL. CXR: pulmonary edema. Echo: severe global hypokinesis, LVEF 18%. He was admitted to the CCU for cardiogenic shock, started on norepinephrine, dobutamine, and furosemide drips. Due to persistent hypotension and end-organ dysfunction, Impella CP device was placed on HD2 for mechanical circulatory support.

**Imaging:**
- **CXR 5/29**: Bilateral pulmonary edema, vascular congestion, mild cardiomegaly
- **Echo 5/29**: LVEF 18%, severe global hypokinesis, no LV thrombus, mild MR
- **CT Head 5/29**: Old contusion, no acute bleed
- **Repeat Echo 6/5**: LVEF improved to 28% on Impella support

---

**Problem-Based Assessment & Plan:**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute CHF Exacerbation**
   - s/p NSTEMI with persistent shock, LVEF 18%
   - Required high-dose inotropes/vasopressors; Impella CP placed HD2, significant hemodynamic improvement, weaning vasopressors
   - Daily echo evaluation, close monitoring of device position/perfusion
   - Plan: Wean Impella as tolerated, transition to oral HF regimen, consider LVAD/MCS if recovery inadequate

**2. Acute Renal Injury (secondary to shock)**
   - Peak Cr 2.6, now improved to 1.1
   - Oliguric initially, now making >0.5 cc/kg/hr
   - Monitored lytes, replaced K/Mg as needed
   - Plan: Continue daily labs, avoid nephrotoxins, monitor for recovery

**3. Respiratory Failure / Pulmonary Edema**
   - Intubated HD1 for hypoxemia, on low vent settings now
   - Diuresis ongoing, CXR improving
   - Plan: Wean sedation, SBT qAM, extubate when criteria met

**4. Anemia (chronic, acute on chronic)**
   - Hgb nadir 10.4, stable, no evidence of active bleeding
   - Iron studies pending, B12 repleted
   - Plan: Monitor H/H, transfuse if <8 or symptomatic

**5. Prediabetes / Hyperglycemia**
   - Glucose fluctuated (85-161), no insulin drip required
   - Plan: FS q6h, sliding scale, resume PO agents when eating

**6. Ischemic Heart Disease / Hyperlipidemia**
   - Restarted statin, on dual antiplatelet therapy
   - Plan: Cardiac rehab, outpatient follow-up, risk factor modification

**7. Recent Acute Bronchitis**
   - Completed azithromycin, no current respiratory infection
   - Plan: Monitor for secondary infections

**8. History of Concussion**
   - CT head negative for acute pathology
   - No neuro deficits off sedation
   - Plan: Neuro checks q4h

**9. Delirium Prevention**
   - Sedation holidays, mobilize as tolerated
   - Plan: Minimize sedation, reorient, sleep hygiene

**10. VTE Prophylaxis**
   - On SQ heparin, SCDs

**11. Lines/Devices**
   - Daily site checks, remove as soon as feasible
   - Foley d/c when extubated

**12. Disposition/Social**
   - Will need cardiac rehab, social work to assess needs for home support

---

**Medications (Hospital Day 8):**
- Norepinephrine (weaning)
- Dobutamine (weaning)

---

**To Do:**
- Continue weaning Impella/device eval
- Reassess for extubation
- Monitor renal function, lytes
- Cardiology: LVAD candidacy if poor recovery

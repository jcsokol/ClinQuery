## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Mr. Ricardo Valentín is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history notable for chronic sinusitis, prediabetes, chronic anemia, and recent right ankle fracture s/p ORIF (outside hospital, 3 weeks prior) who presented to the ED with acute-onset dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest pain. He was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with low cardiac output and evidence of cardiogenic shock. He required escalation to ICU care and ultimately placement of a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

His course was complicated by acute kidney injury, transient hepatic dysfunction, volume overload, and multifactorial anemia. He was managed with diuresis, inotropic support, and serial monitoring of end-organ function. The Impella device was successfully explanted on hospital day 7 after hemodynamic stability was achieved.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (new)**
   - **Summary:** Presented with hypotension, cold extremities, JVD, S3 on exam. Echo: EF 15%, severe global hypokinesis, moderate MR, no tamponade. Coronary angio: non-obstructive CAD.
   - **Interventions:** Norepinephrine, dobutamine, lasix drip, Impella CP placed (day 1), Swan-Ganz for monitoring.
   - **Course:** Gradual improvement in perfusion, weaned off pressors by day 6, device explanted day 7.
   - **Plan:** Continue GDMT (carvedilol held, start low-dose enalapril, spironolactone). Cardiac rehab consult. Outpt. heart failure follow-up. Consider AICD if EF persists <35%.

### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) – likely cardiorenal**
   - **Summary:** Cr peaked at 2.1 on day 2, baseline ~1.0. BUN up to 44. Oliguria improved with diuresis and improved CO.
   - **Plan:** Monitor daily labs, avoid nephrotoxins, strict I/Os. Renal function improving.

### 3. **Anemia (chronic, multifactorial; acute on chronic during admission)**
   - **Summary:** Baseline Hgb ~11, nadir 8.1 on day 2. Etiology: chronic disease, possible dilutional, minor GI loss (occult positive on day 3), no overt bleeding.
   - **Plan:** Monitored. No transfusion required. Iron studies pending. Continue GI prophylaxis. F/u outpatient GI.

### 4. **Volume Overload / Hyponatremia**
   - **Summary:** Noted 7kg wt gain, peripheral edema. Na nadir 128, improved with diuresis.  
   - **Plan:** Resume PO diuretics, fluid restrict <1.5L/day, daily weights.

### 5. **Prediabetes**
   - **Summary:** HbA1c 5.8%. Mild hyperglycemia during acute illness (glucose up to 174).  
   - **Plan:** Sliding scale insulin as needed, resume metformin on discharge. Diabetes education.

### 6. **Chronic Sinusitis**
   - **Plan:** Continue fluticasone nasal spray. No acute symptoms.

### 7. **Recent Ankle Fx s/p ORIF**
   - **Plan:** Ortho f/u. Immobilizer in place. PT/OT consult for mobility. DVT prophylaxis (enoxaparin held due to low platelets day 2, restarted later).

### 8. **Pain**
   - **Plan:** PRN acetaminophen. Avoid NSAIDs (renal). Gabapentin for neuropathic symptoms. Pain well controlled.

### 9. **Other**
   - **Vaccinations:** Up to date.  
   - **Dispo:** Anticipate transfer to stepdown, then home with home health.

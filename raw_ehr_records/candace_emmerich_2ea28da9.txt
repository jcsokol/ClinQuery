# ICU PROGRESS NOTE

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Worsening dyspnea and chest pain.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Candace Emmerich is a 62-year-old female with a past medical history notable for obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, and chronic microvascular complications (diabetic retinopathy), who presented to the ED with 24 hours of progressive dyspnea, lower extremity edema, orthopnea, and intermittent chest discomfort.  

On arrival, she was hypotensive (BP 82/54), tachycardic, and hypoxic (O2 sat 87% RA). ECG showed new T wave inversions in V2-V4. Troponin I was elevated at 2.7 ng/mL; BNP 2,100 pg/mL. CXR: pulmonary edema. She was admitted to the ICU for management of acute decompensated heart failure and concern for cardiogenic shock.  

Despite diuresis and inotropes, she remained hypotensive and oliguric; thus, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed for temporary mechanical circulatory support on hospital day 2. She stabilized hemodynamically with improved urine output and end-organ perfusion.  

Her course was complicated by AKI, mild transaminitis, and a UTI (E. coli on urine culture). She also developed hyperglycemia requiring insulin drip and persistent leukocytosis.

## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

- **Day 1:** Admission to ICU for cardiogenic shock. Initiation of norepinephrine and dobutamine.  
- **Day 2:** Persistent shock; Impella CP placed.  
- **Day 3:** Hemodynamics improved. Weaned off vasopressors. Started on IV Lasix.  
- **Day 4:** Ongoing volume overload. Developed AKI (Cr peaked at 2.1), mild transaminitis (AST/ALT 78/95).  
- **Day 5:** Blood cultures negative, urine culture + for E. coli. Started on nitrofurantoin.  
- **Day 6:** Impella weaned and removed. Transitioned to oral heart failure regimen.  
- **Day 7:** Gradual improvement. Transferred to step-down unit.

# PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock, NSTEMI, Heart Failure (LVEF 15%)

**Assessment:**  
Acute decompensated heart failure secondary to NSTEMI, complicated by cardiogenic shock. Required temporary LV support with Impella. Improved after device placement.

**Plan:**  
- Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): beta-blocker, ACEi, aldosterone antagonist as tolerated  
- Daily weights, strict I/O  
- Cardiac rehab consult  
- Repeat echo prior to discharge  
- Telemetry, monitor for arrhythmias  
- Optimize volume status

## 2. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, Hyperglycemia

**Assessment:**  
Longstanding DM2, poorly controlled; on admission, severe hyperglycemia requiring insulin drip.

**Plan:**  
- Transition to basal-bolus insulin regimen  
- Monitor glucose q4h  
- Endocrine consult  
- Hold metformin until renal function recovers

## 3. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, multifactorial)

**Assessment:**  
AKI likely secondary to hypoperfusion and nephrotoxic meds.

**Plan:**  
- Monitor renal function daily  
- Avoid nephrotoxins  
- Adjust medication dosing  
- IV fluids as needed for perfusion

## 4. Obesity, Metabolic Syndrome, Hypertriglyceridemia

**Assessment:**  
BMI 28.4, metabolic syndrome, elevated baseline triglycerides.

**Plan:**  
- Nutrition consult  
- Encourage low-sodium, heart-healthy diet  
- Continue statin therapy  
- Consider addition of fenofibrate if TG >400

## 5. E. coli Urinary Tract Infection

**Assessment:**  
Symptomatic UTI, urine culture positive for E. coli.

**Plan:**  
- Continue nitrofurantoin x7 days  
- Monitor for sepsis  
- Repeat urinalysis after completion

## 6. Acute Bronchitis, Viral Sinusitis

**Assessment:**  
Cough, congestion on admission; viral panel negative, mild bronchitis.

**Plan:**  
- Supportive care  
- PRN acetaminophen for fever  
- Monitor for secondary infection

## 7. Diabetic Retinopathy

**Assessment:**  
Chronic complication of DM2.

**Plan:**  
- Ophthalmology f/u outpatient  
- Optimize glycemic control

## 8. Hypertension

**Assessment:**  
Longstanding; difficult to control during shock state.

**Plan:**  
- Resume home antihypertensives as tolerated  
- Titrate to goal BP <130/80

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Acute decompensated heart failure, respiratory distress.

---

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Heidi Turner is a 17-year-old female with h/o perennial allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, multiple severe environmental and food allergies, and recent viral upper respiratory tract infection, who presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive SOB, orthopnea, and chest discomfort. She developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. Cardiac workup revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction (EF 18%) and elevated cardiac biomarkers. She was transferred to the PICU and ultimately required placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock.

Notably, she had a recent episode of viral pharyngitis and sinusitis, and one day prior to admission, sustained a minor laceration to the right thigh after a fall (cleaned, no signs of infection). No preceding chest pain or palpitations. No prior cardiac history.

## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

- **Day 1:** Admitted to PICU. Intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Started on inotropes (milrinone, epinephrine). Echo: severe global hypokinesis, LVEF 18%. Troponin I: 8.2 ng/mL. BNP: 3,750 pg/mL. 
- **Day 2:** Worsening hypotension, rising lactate (4.8 mmol/L), oliguric. Impella CP placed at bedside for cardiogenic shock. Started on broad-spectrum abx (vanc, cefepime) for possible sepsis. 
- **Day 3:** Improvement in perfusion, weaned off epi. Persistent mild transaminitis. Extubated to HFNC.  
- **Day 4-6:** Hemodynamics stable. Impella weaned, removed on Day 6. Gradual improvement in LVEF to 38% by repeat echo.  
- **Day 7:** Transferred to step-down. Mobilizing with PT/OT.  
- **Day 8:** Discharged home with close cardiology and allergy follow-up.

### 2. **Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure**
- Intubated, now extubated. O2 sat >98% on RA.

### 3. **Recent viral pharyngitis/sinusitis**
- Enterovirus+; no bacterial superinfection.
- Plan: Supportive care.

### 4. **Atopic dermatitis**
- Stable. Continue topical hydrocortisone.

### 5. **Severe environmental/food allergies**
- Latex, shrimp, dust mite, cat dander, etc.
- Plan: Epi auto-injector at discharge. Allergy f/u.

### 6. **Transaminitis**
- Mild, improving as cardiac function recovers.
- Plan: Monitor LFTs outpt.

### 7. **Right thigh laceration**
- Superficial, clean, no signs of infection.
- Plan: Local wound care.

### 8. **Nutrition, Mobility, Psychosocial**

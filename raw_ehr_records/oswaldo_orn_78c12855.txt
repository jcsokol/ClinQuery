### ADMISSION SUMMARY

**CC:** Altered mental status, hypotension, fever  
**HPI:**  
Oswaldo Orn is a 30-year-old male with a PMH significant only for recent streptococcal pharyngitis and otitis media (treated with penicillin and amoxicillin) who presented to the ED after 3 days of malaise, persistent fever (Tmax 39.1°C), myalgias, and progressive shortness of breath. Family reported confusion and new-onset palpitations. On arrival, he was febrile, tachycardic (HR 132), hypotensive (BP 82/49), and hypoxic (SpO2 91% RA). Exam notable for JVD, S3 gallop, bilateral rales, and cool extremities. CXR: pulmonary edema. ECG: sinus tachycardia, nonspecific ST-T changes. Troponin I mildly elevated. Echo: severely reduced LVEF (15%), global hypokinesis, moderate MR. Rapidly deteriorated requiring intubation and vasopressors.

He was transferred to the MICU, where he developed worsening cardiogenic shock refractory to escalating pressors and inotropes. Emergent placement of a left-sided Impella CP device was performed at bedside by CV surgery. Infectious workup pending; empiric vanc/cefepime started. Course complicated by AKI, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia.

### HOSPITAL COURSE (Summary)

- **Day 1:** Cardiac arrest x1, ROSC after 2 min CPR, intubated, started norepinephrine, dobutamine. Lactate 6.8. Echo: LVEF 15%. Impella CP placed.  
- **Day 2:** Stable on Impella, pressors weaned. Renal function worsened, started CRRT.  
- **Day 4:** Cultures negative. TTE: No vegetations.  
- **Day 6:** Improved mentation, weaned off Impella, extubated day 7.  
- **Day 8:** Transferred to stepdown, improved labs, residual mild heart failure.  
- **Day 10:** Discharged home with close f/u, GDMT for HF initiated, outpatient cardiac MRI planned.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Fulminant Myocarditis
- **Assessment:** Severe biventricular dysfunction, likely viral myocarditis (parainfluenza PCR +), acute decompensated HF, profound shock.
- **Plan:**
  - Impella CP placed day 1, removed day 6
  - Milrinone transitioned to oral carvedilol, lisinopril (titrated as tolerated)
  - Diuresis with IV furosemide
  - Serial Echos
  - Cardiac MRI outpatient
  - Monitor for arrhythmia; metoprolol PRN

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO Stage 3)
- **Assessment:** Multifactorial: hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic abx, myoglobinuria suspected.
- **Plan:**
  - CRRT initiated day 2, discontinued day 7
  - Daily BMP, strict I/O, nephrology consult
  - Hold nephrotoxins, dose-adjust abx

### 3. Sepsis, Source: unclear (likely viral)
- **Assessment:** Fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, negative cultures, viral PCR positive
- **Plan:**
  - Broad-spectrum abx x72hr, discontinued after negative cultures
  - Viral PCR panel sent, parainfluenza A positive
  - Supportive care

### 4. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
- **Assessment:** Cardiogenic pulmonary edema, intubated days 1–6
- **Plan:**
  - Protective lung ventilation
  - Diuresis, daily CXR
  - Extubated successfully day 7

### 5. Thrombocytopenia (Nadir Plt 38K)
- **Assessment:** Likely multifactorial: sepsis, CRRT, Impella, meds
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor CBC daily
  - Plt transfusion x1 (Plt < 20K)
  - Hematology consult

### 6. Streptococcal pharyngitis/otitis media (remote)
- **Assessment:** Completed abx pre-admission, no active infection
- **Plan:** No further intervention

### 7. Pain, mild
- **Assessment:** Reports 3/10 pain, managed with acetaminophen
- **Plan:** PRN acetaminophen, avoid NSAIDs due to AKI

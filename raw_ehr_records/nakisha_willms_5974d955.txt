### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity swelling.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Nakisha Willms is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) with reduced ejection fraction (EF ~30%), hyperlipidemia, prediabetes, fibromyalgia, and recurrent viral sinusitis, who was admitted from the ED with worsening heart failure symptoms. She presented with several days of exertional shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and bilateral lower extremity edema. She also reported decreased appetite, mild confusion, and intermittent palpitations. She denied chest pain, fever, or recent sick contacts. Her home medications include metoprolol succinate, Lasix, simvastatin, pregabalin, milnacipran, duloxetine, and vitamin B12.

On arrival, she was tachypneic, mildly hypertensive, and hypoxic to 89% on room air. She was admitted to the ICU for acute-on-chronic decompensated heart failure with evidence of hypoperfusion (cool extremities, rising creatinine, hypotension on day 2). Despite aggressive diuresis and uptitration of inotropes, her hemodynamics deteriorated, and she required the placement of a temporary left-sided ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 3 for cardiogenic shock.

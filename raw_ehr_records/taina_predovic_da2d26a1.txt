## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock, s/p Impella CP Placement
- **Assessment:** Severe acute LV systolic dysfunction, likely viral myocarditis vs. stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy. Required mechanical circulatory support.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Impella CP placed, successfully weaned and removed  
  - Continue GDMT for HFrEF (metoprolol succ, sacubitril-valsartan, spironolactone)  
  - Monitor for arrhythmia/recurrence  
  - Cardiac MRI pending for etiology  
  - Cardiac rehab referral

### 2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, s/p Intubation  
- **Assessment:** Secondary to pulmonary edema and shock.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Off vent, on O2 PRN  
  - Diurese to euvolemia  
  - Daily chest PT  
  - Monitor for aspiration

### 3. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)  
- **Assessment:** Likely pre-renal from shock, improved with perfusion.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor renal function  
  - Avoid nephrotoxins  
  - Maintain adequate MAP

### 4. Transaminitis  
- **Assessment:** Likely ischemic hepatitis during low-flow state, now improving.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Trending LFTs  
  - No hepatotoxins  
  - GI consult if worsens

### 5. Hypertension  
- **Assessment:** Off antihypertensives during shock; will need re-initiation as tolerated.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Restart HCTZ, titrate as tolerated  
  - Add ACEi/ARB as above  
  - Monitor BP

### 6. Delirium  
- **Assessment:** Likely multifactorial (ICU, sedatives, shock).  
- **Plan:**  
  - Reorient  
  - Minimize sedatives  
  - Haldol PRN

### 7. Remote Rotator Cuff Injury, Burns, Concussion  
- **Assessment:** Not contributing to current illness.  
- **Plan:**  
  - PT/OT for shoulder mobility  
  - Routine follow-up as outpatient

### 8. Recurrent Viral URIs/Sinusitis/Pharyngitis  
- **Assessment:** Recent viral illness may have triggered cardiac event.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor for secondary infection  
  - Supportive care

### 9. Contraception/Pregnancy  
- **Assessment:** On multiple contraceptives, not pregnant.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue home regimen  
  - Counseling at discharge

---

## DISCHARGE PLANNING

- Anticipate discharge home in 2-3 days  
- Needs close cardiology f/u  
- Cardiac rehab referral  
- Home health for PT/OT  
- Medication reconciliation pending

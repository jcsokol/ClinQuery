### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Adolph Williamson, a 31-year-old male with a past medical history notable for recurrent viral sinusitis and acute bronchitis, presented to the emergency department with 2 days of worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and pleuritic chest pain. Family reports recent viral URI symptoms. He was found to be tachypneic, hypoxic, and hypotensive on arrival. Initial workup revealed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and elevated cardiac biomarkers. He rapidly deteriorated to cardiogenic shock, requiring intubation and vasopressors. TTE revealed severe global LV hypokinesis with LVEF ~15%. He was transferred to the ICU and ultimately required placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Acute Fulminant Myocarditis**
- **Assessment:** Likely viral etiology (recent URI, no CAD risk factors, no ischemic changes). Severe LV dysfunction.  
- **Plan:**
  - Temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placed day 2, weaned off on day 7.
  - Milrinone infusion for inotropic support, titrated down as cardiac function improved.
  - Close hemodynamic monitoring (A-line, CVP).
  - Serial Echos: LVEF improved to 40% by day 8.
  - Infectious workup (resp viral PCR, blood cultures) sent.
  - Cardiology, CT surgery, and Infectious Disease consults.
  - Empiric IV methylprednisolone x3d for suspected myocarditis.
  - Goal-directed medical therapy for heart failure initiated as tolerated (low-dose metoprolol, lisinopril).

### 2. **Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure**
- **Assessment:** Multifactorial: pulmonary edema, possible aspiration, underlying bronchitis.
- **Plan:**
  - Intubated, transitioned to pressure support, extubated successfully on day 5.
  - Diuresis with IV furosemide.
  - Chest X-ray: bilateral infiltrates, improved over time.
  - Sputum cultures negative.
  - Incentive spirometry, pulmonary hygiene.

### 3. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**
- **Assessment:** Likely pre-renal from low cardiac output, diuretic use.
- **Plan:**
  - Monitored daily BMP, urine output.
  - IVF resuscitation initially, then negative fluid balance.
  - Creatinine peaked at 2.1, returned to baseline (1.0) by day 10.
  - No need for renal replacement therapy.

### 4. **Viral Sinusitis / Acute Bronchitis**
- **Assessment:** Ongoing cough, nasal congestion. No evidence of bacterial superinfection.
- **Plan:**
  - Supportive care (acetaminophen/dextromethorphan/doxylamine syrup).
  - Nasal saline irrigations.
  - Monitor for complications.

### 5. **Critical Illness Polyneuropathy / Myopathy**
- **Assessment:** Mild weakness on awakening/extubation; likely ICU-related.
- **Plan:**
  - Early PT/OT mobilization.
  - DVT prophylaxis (heparin SQ).
  - Nutrition support (high protein enteral feeds).

### 6. **Other Issues**
- Stress ulcer prophylaxis (pantoprazole).
- Glycemic control (sliding scale insulin; no DKA/HHS).
- Monitor for device-related complications (hemolysis, limb ischemia, infection).
- Family and social work support.

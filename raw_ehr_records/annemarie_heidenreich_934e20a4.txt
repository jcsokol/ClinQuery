**Hospital Course Summary**
Ms. Annemarie Heidenreich is a 55-year-old female with a history of obesity, prior miscarriage, and colon polyps admitted for acute shortness of breath, orthopnea, and progressive lower extremity edema. On arrival, she was hypotensive and hypoxic, requiring urgent intubation and vasopressor support. Cardiac workup revealed severely depressed LV systolic function (EF 15%) and elevated cardiac biomarkers. She rapidly progressed to cardiogenic shock refractory to medical therapy, necessitating placement of a temporary percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) on hospital day 1. Her ICU course was complicated by acute kidney injury, transient atrial fibrillation, and volume overload. She has since stabilized, was weaned off vasopressors, and transitioned to inotropes. The LVAD was successfully explanted on day 6. She is currently on telemetry, diuresis, and guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure.

**Assessment & Plan**

1. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure / Cardiogenic Shock**
   - Severe ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%), presented in shock.
   - Required Impella CP placement day 1 for hemodynamic support.
   - Now weaned to dobutamine 2.5 mcg/kg/min, off pressors.
   - GDMT initiated: carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone.
   - Diuresis ongoing (IV furosemide), net negative 5.2L since admission.
   - Continue daily weights, strict I/Os, uptitrate GDMT as tolerated.
   - Cardiology and HF teams following.

2. **Temporary LVAD (Impella)**
   - Placed for refractory shock, removed on day 6.
   - No evidence of device-related vascular complications.
   - Serial vascular checks, dopplers negative for DVT.
   - Monitor for hemolysis (LDH, haptoglobin), renal function.

3. **Volume Overload**
   - Significant improvement, now euvolemic.
   - Continue IV diuresis, transition to oral as tolerated.
   - Monitor BMP, daily weights, adjust diuretic dose per urine output.

4. **Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO stage 2)**
   - Presumed pre-renal, multifactorial (hypoperfusion, diuretics).
   - Baseline Cr 0.9, peaked at 2.2 on day 3, trending down to 1.4.
   - Hold nephrotoxins, monitor renal function, adjust diuretics.

5. **Atrial Fibrillation with RVR**
   - Brief episode on day 2 (HR to 140s), cardioverted with amiodarone.
   - Maintained NSR since, on metoprolol.
   - No anticoagulation started (bleeding risk, low CHADS2VASC).
   - Telemetry monitoring.

6. **Obesity**
   - BMI 30.2 on admission.
   - Nutrition consult placed, calorie restriction.
   - Counsel on weight reduction post-discharge.

7. **History of Colon Polyp**
   - 5mm polyp removed 2022, no dysplasia.
   - No GI bleeding this admission.
   - F/u with GI as outpatient.

8. **Remote Miscarriage**
   - No acute issues.

9. **Recurrent Pharyngitis/Sinusitis**
   - No active infection on admission.
   - No antibiotics required.

10. **Medication Reconciliation**
    - Reviewed home meds.
    - Continue hydrocortisone cream, hold penicillin (no current infection).
    - PRN diphenhydramine, epinephrine injector available.

11. **VTE Prophylaxis**
    - SCDs in place, on enoxaparin 40 mg daily.

12. **Nutrition**
    - On cardiac diet, PO intake adequate.
    - Monitor electrolytes.

13. **Pain Control**
    - Mild chronic pain, rated 3/10.
    - Acetaminophen PRN.

**HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:**

Ms. Donnelly is a 48-year-old female with h/o poorly controlled HTN, obesity (BMI ~29), chronic migraines, and chronic sinusitis, who presented to the ED with 2 weeks of progressive dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. On presentation, she was tachycardic, hypotensive, hypoxic, and found to be in acute pulmonary edema with evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion (creatinine 2.2 mg/dL, lactate 4.1 mmol/L). She rapidly deteriorated and required intubation, vasopressors, and was transferred to the ICU.

Despite optimization of preload and afterload, she remained in refractory cardiogenic shock. Emergent bedside echocardiogram revealed severely depressed LVEF (~15%), moderate RV dysfunction, and global hypokinesis. Multidisciplinary decision made for temporary mechanical circulatory support. A left-sided percutaneous axial-flow heart pump (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 1. She was managed with anticoagulation, inotropes, and diuresis. Gradual improvement observed, with explantation of Impella on day 6.

Complicated by:  
- AKI (stage II, non-oliguric, improved with perfusion)  
- Transient transaminitis  
- New-onset atrial fibrillation (resolved)  
- Multiple episodes of hypotension requiring vasopressors  
- Migraine exacerbation (treated with acetaminophen, antiemetics)  
- Superimposed bacterial sinusitis (treated with ceftriaxone)

She was successfully extubated on day 7, transitioned to oral heart failure regimen, and transferred to stepdown on day 10.

**PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

---

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to decompensated heart failure (new reduced EF)**
   - **Assessment:** Severe LV systolic dysfunction, likely hypertensive heart disease. Profound hypoperfusion with multi-organ dysfunction at presentation.  
   - **Plan:**  
     - Temporary LV support (Impella CP, HD 1–6)  
     - Vasopressors (norepinephrine, vasopressin) for MAP >65  
     - Inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone titrated)  
     - Serial TTEs  
     - Strict I/Os, daily weights  
     - Transition to goal-directed HF therapy (carvedilol, sacubitril-valsartan, spironolactone) as tolerated  
     - Cardiology f/u, consider advanced HF referral

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO stage II)**
   - **Assessment:** Likely pre-renal, secondary to low cardiac output. Peak Cr 2.7 mg/dL (baseline ~1.0).  
   - **Plan:**  
     - Optimize MAP/perfusion  
     - Avoid nephrotoxins  
     - Renal dose adjust all medications  
     - Monitor UOP, daily BMP  
     - Renal consult

**3. Transaminitis**
   - **Assessment:** Mild AST/ALT elevation, likely “shock liver” (ischemic hepatitis). No evidence of biliary obstruction or viral hepatitis.  
   - **Plan:**  
     - Monitor LFTs q48h  
     - Supportive care

**4. New-onset Atrial Fibrillation**
   - **Assessment:** Paroxysmal, rate-related, no evidence of embolic phenomenon.  
   - **Plan:**  
     - Rate control (IV metoprolol)  
     - Anticoagulation (heparin drip while Impella in place)  
     - Rhythm monitoring  
     - CHADS-VASC calculated (score 2)  
     - Cardiology to determine long-term anticoagulation

**5. Chronic Hypertension**
   - **Assessment:** Poorly controlled, contributed to decompensation.  
   - **Plan:**  
     - Resume home regimen as tolerated (amlodipine/HCTZ/olmesartan)  
     - Titrate as BP allows

**6. Obesity (BMI 28-29)**
   - **Assessment:** Risk factor for HF, OSA (not previously evaluated).  
   - **Plan:**  
     - Dietician consult  
     - Encourage weight loss  
     - Consider sleep study outpatient

**7. Chronic Migraine**
   - **Assessment:** Exacerbated by stress/illness; managed with acetaminophen, antiemetics.  
   - **Plan:**  
     - Avoid triptans/NSAIDs due to AKI  
     - Continue acetaminophen PRN  
     - Neurology consult for preventive management

**8. Chronic Sinusitis/Allergic Rhinitis**
   - **Assessment:** Baseline, but with acute exacerbation (purulent drainage, facial pain).  
   - **Plan:**  
     - ENT consult  
     - Ceftriaxone IV x5d, then PO  
     - Continue chlorpheniramine  
     - Nasal saline irrigations

**9. Contraceptive Management**
   - **Assessment:** Multiple forms in chart (some not current).  
   - **Plan:**  
     - Clarify active contraception  
     - Hold hormonal agents during acute illness  
     - Gyn consult if needed

**10. DVT Prophylaxis**
   - **Plan:**  
     - SCDs until ambulating  
     - Heparin for anticoagulation while Impella in place

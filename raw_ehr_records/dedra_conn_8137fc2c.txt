### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Shortness of breath, chest pain, and lower extremity edema.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Dedra Conn is a 68-year-old female with a history of obesity (BMI ~30), chronic sinusitis, osteoarthritis of the knee, and remote clavicle fracture, presenting to the ED with acute onset of chest pain, progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and bilateral leg swelling over 3 days. She was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure on arrival, with hypotension and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. She rapidly deteriorated on the floor, requiring transfer to the ICU for escalating vasopressor support. Given persistent cardiogenic shock refractory to medical management (dobutamine, norepinephrine), a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed for hemodynamic support.

---

### HOSPITAL COURSE
- Day 1: Admitted to ED with acute SOB, CXR with pulmonary edema, BNP 2100, troponin mildly elevated (0.14, peaked 0.22). Started on IV furosemide, O2, and nitro drip.  
- Day 2: Worsening hypotension, rising creatinine, transferred to ICU. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine.  
- Day 3: Echocardiogram: LVEF ~15%, global hypokinesis. Cardiology consulted. Given persistent shock, Impella CP placed via right femoral artery.  
- Day 4-7: Gradual improvement in perfusion, down-titration of vasopressors. Diuresis intensified. Monitored for hemolysis and device-related complications.  
- Day 8: Impella weaned and removed. LVEF improved to 28%.  
- Day 9-12: Steady improvement, transitioned to oral heart failure therapy. Monitored for arrhythmias and secondary infections.  
- Day 13: Preparing for transfer to step-down with plans for outpatient heart failure follow-up.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (HFrEF, new dx)**
   - Etiology likely ischemic vs viral myocarditis (coronary angio deferred due to AKI)
   - Required Impella CP for refractory shock, weaned off after 5 days
   - Now hemodynamically stable on PO therapy
   - Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): ACEi, BB, loop diuretic, statin
   - Daily weights, strict I/O, titrate diuretics
   - Cardiology follow-up, consider outpatient cardiac MRI

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, resolved)**
   - Likely secondary to low cardiac output
   - Improving with restoration of perfusion and diuresis
   - Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins

**3. Volume Overload/Pulmonary Edema**
   - Managed with IV diuresis, now improving
   - Continue diuresis, monitor electrolytes

**4. Obesity**
   - Counsel on diet, activity as tolerated after discharge

**5. Chronic Sinusitis, OA, prior injuries**
   - No acute issues during admission
   - Continue usual pain management as needed

**6. Infection prophylaxis**
   - Monitor for device/line-related infection, none to date

**7. DVT Prophylaxis**
   - On heparin SQ, ambulating with PT as tolerated

**8. Social/Disposition**
   - Anticipate transfer to step-down, then home with HF nurse follow-up
   - Education on heart failure, med compliance, daily weights

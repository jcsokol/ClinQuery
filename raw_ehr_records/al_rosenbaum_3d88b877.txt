## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Al Rosenbaum is a 25-year-old male with a past medical history notable for perennial allergic rhinitis, recurrent otitis media, hypertension, viral sinusitis, and prior episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis, who presented to the ED with worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest pain. On arrival, he was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive with evidence of pulmonary edema. Initial labs and imaging were concerning for acute decompensated heart failure, likely secondary to myocarditis (see below). He rapidly deteriorated, requiring intubation and vasopressor support, ultimately progressing to cardiogenic shock. Due to persistent hypotension and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion despite maximal medical therapy, a decision was made to place a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2.

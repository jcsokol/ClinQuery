Patient Name: Kent Ruecker
MRN: 001703492
DOB: 10/05/1960   Sex: M
Admit Date: 03/18/2024
Attending: Dr. S. Conrad
Service: Medical ICU
Room: 5-321B
Type: Inpatient
Consults: Cardiology, GI, Infectious Disease

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Acute dyspnea, chest pain, hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Kent Ruecker is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obesity, chronic sinusitis, prediabetes, anemia, recurrent colon polyps, and prior colon cancer on chemotherapy (oxaliplatin, leucovorin) who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and acute fatigue. At home, he developed orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. No recent fever, but noted dry cough and palpitations.

In the ED, he was found to be hypotensive (BP 82/54), tachycardic (HR 121), hypoxic (SpO2 88% RA), and in respiratory distress. Exam notable for JVD, rales, new S3, and cool extremities. He was admitted to ICU for cardiogenic shock. Initial TTE showed severe global LV systolic dysfunction (EF 20%), mild RV dysfunction, and no pericardial effusion. Troponin I was elevated (see labs). He rapidly developed worsening end-organ dysfunction (AKI, transaminitis, elevated lactate), requiring norepinephrine and dobutamine. Cardiology was consulted, and a left-sided temporary percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) was placed at bedside for circulatory support.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Hypertension
- Obesity (BMI prior to admission 30.2)
- Chronic sinusitis
- Prediabetes
- Anemia (baseline Hgb 9-10)
- Recurrent colon polyp, history of malignant colon tumor (status post resection, on chemotherapy)
- Acute bronchitis (resolved)

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
- Colon resection (2023)
- Polypectomies (multiple)
- No CABG/PCI

FAMILY HISTORY:
- Father: MI age 71, DM2
- Mother: Colon cancer, HTN

SOCIAL HISTORY:
- Former tobacco use (quit 2008), no EtOH, no illicit drugs.
- Lives with spouse, retired accountant.

ALLERGIES:
- NKDA

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
- Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily
- Acetaminophen 325 mg PRN
- Leucovorin 100 mg IV
- Oxaliplatin 50 mg IV q2wks

HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:
03/18/24: Admitted to ICU, intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Started on norepi/dobutamine for shock. Echo: new severe LV dysfunction. Labs: troponin I 3.2 ng/mL, lactate 6.1. Cardiology: Impella CP placed via R femoral artery.
03/19-03/22: Remained dependent on Impella and vasopressors. Renal function worsened (Cr up to 2.3). Required CRRT x2 days for volume overload. Developed mild transaminitis (AST 121, ALT 89). Anemia worsened; transfused 2U PRBC. Blood cultures negative.
03/23: Gradual improvement in cardiac index, vasopressors weaned. Echo: LVEF improved to 35%. Impella CP removed 03/24.
03/24-03/26: Continued improvement, extubated 03/25. Diuresed, transitioned to oral antihypertensives. Chemotherapy held. No new arrhythmias.
03/27: Transferred to stepdown. Awaiting further oncologic management.

PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Severe LV Dysfunction (EF 20%), Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
   - Presentation: Hypotension, hypoxia, end-organ hypoperfusion, high troponin, severe LV dysfunction.
   - Etiology: Likely multifactorial: chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity (oxaliplatin), hypertensive heart disease, ischemic insult (no clear MI).
   - Management:
     - Impella CP placed for temporary LV support, weaned off on 3/24/24.
     - Vasopressors/inotropes (norepinephrine, dobutamine), now discontinued.
     - Diuresis (IV furosemide).
     - Serial Echos: improving LVEF.
     - Cardiology f/u for long-term management, consider GDMT for HF.
     - Monitor for arrhythmias.

2. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) on CKD**
   - Likely secondary to low cardiac output and hypotension.
   - Required CRRT x2d for volume overload, now off.
   - Renal function improving, creatinine trending down.
   - Monitor UOP, lytes, avoid nephrotoxins.

3. **Anemia, Chronic and Acute on Chronic**
   - Baseline Hgb 9-10, dropped to 7.3 during shock.
   - Transfused 2U PRBC; no overt GI bleeding.
   - Hemolysis w/u negative. Likely multifactorial (hemodilution, chronic disease, chemo).
   - Monitor CBC, iron studies pending.

4. **Malignant Colon Tumor, s/p Resection, On Chemo**
   - Chemotherapy (oxaliplatin, leucovorin) held during ICU stay.
   - No evidence of GI bleeding.
   - Oncology to reassess prior to discharge.

5. **Obesity, Hypertension, Prediabetes**
   - Meds held during shock, now restarted as tolerated.
   - Encourage salt/fluid restriction, monitor glycemic control.
   - Will need outpatient f/u for weight, BP, DM screening.

6. **Transaminitis**
   - Mild-moderate, peaked with shock/liver hypoperfusion.
   - Trending down as perfusion improves.

7. **Other (Sinusitis, Hx bronchitis, Polyps)**
   - No active infection.
   - No current respiratory symptoms post-extubation.

DISPOSITION:
- Transfer to stepdown, anticipate discharge home with close cardiology and oncology f/u.
- Cardiac rehab referral.
- Outpatient echo and labs in 1-2 weeks.

PHYSICIAN ATTESTATION:
I personally evaluated this patient, reviewed all data, and performed all procedures as documented above.

- Lisinopril 5 mg daily
- Furosemide 40 mg daily
- Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily
- Acetaminophen 325 mg PRN
- Hold chemotherapy pending oncology f/u

FOLLOW-UP:
- Cardiology (1 wk)
- Oncology (2 wks)
- Primary Care (2 wks)
- Cardiac rehab referral

Patient and family educated on diet, fluid restriction, medication adherence, and signs of decompensation.

### **Chief Complaint**
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest heaviness for 4 days.

---

### **History of Present Illness**
Mr. Glenn Gulgowski is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent viral upper respiratory infection (sinusitis), presenting with rapidly worsening dyspnea, lower extremity swelling, and orthopnea. He was initially seen in the ED 4 days ago for a presumed viral syndrome, but returned due to new-onset chest heaviness and near-syncope. On arrival, he was found to be hypotensive, tachycardic, and hypoxic. Cardiac workup revealed elevated troponins and BNP. Echocardiogram demonstrated severe global LV systolic dysfunction (EF ~15%), and he soon required inotropic support for cardiogenic shock. He was transferred to the Cardiac ICU and subsequently required placement of a percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) for ongoing hemodynamic instability.

## **Imaging**
- **5/22**: CXR: Mild pulmonary congestion, no focal infiltrate.
- **5/22**: Echo: Severe global hypokinesis, EF 15%, no LV thrombus.
- **5/25**: Repeat Echo: EF improved to 25%, mild MR, RV function preserved.

---

## **Assessment & Plan**
**1. Cardiogenic Shock (presumed viral myocarditis)**
   - Impella CP placed on HD2 for refractory shock. Now explanted.
   - Transitioned off pressors, on low-dose dobutamine.
   - Diuresed aggressively with IV furosemide.
   - Echo: improving EF (now ~25%).
   - Plan: Continue goal-directed therapy, monitor for arrhythmias, consider GDMT for HFrEF when stable.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, secondary to low output)**
   - Initial Cr peaked at 2.0, now improved to 0.9.
   - Off vasopressors, euvolemic.
   - Monitor I/Os, daily BMP.

**3. Viral Sinusitis/Bronchitis (recent)**
   - Symptoms resolving, no ongoing cough or rhinorrhea.
   - No antibiotics indicated.

**4. Volume Overload**
   - Lower extremity edema, mild pulmonary congestion.
   - On loop diuretics, daily weights.

**5. Hyperlipidemia/Hypertension**
   - Not on home statin or antihypertensive.
   - Hold statin until LFTs normalize.
   - Resume antihypertensive therapy as tolerated.

**6. Pain (mild, ankle sprain remote)**
   - Rare PRN acetaminophen, no opioids needed.

**7. DVT Prophylaxis**
   - On SQ heparin, SCDs in place.

**8. Social/Disposition**
   - Needs PT/OT evaluation prior to discharge.
   - Early discussion with wife regarding goals of care.

**EHR: EPIC Inpatient Progress Note**

---

**Patient Name:** Luis Miguel Estévez  
**MRN:** 00588342  
**DOB:** 10/17/1912 (Age: 111)  
**Sex:** Male  
**Date of Admission:** 6/2/2024  
**Date of Service:** 6/7/2024  
**Admitting Service:** Cardiac ICU  
**Attending:** Dr. L. Vasquez  
**Primary Team:** Cardiology  
**Consults:** Oncology, Endocrinology, Nephrology, Palliative Care

---

**Reason for Admission:**  
Acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock, background of chronic CHF, with resultant need for temporary left-sided mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP) due to refractory hypotension and end-organ hypoperfusion.

---

### **HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:**

Mr. Estévez is a 111-year-old man with a complex medical history including chronic HFrEF (EF ~45%), prostate cancer s/p chemo and leuprolide, prediabetes, anemia, hyperlipidemia, and chronic opioid use, who presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and altered mentation. On arrival, he was hypotensive (SBP 72 mmHg), tachycardic, hypoxic, and oliguric. Initial workup revealed evidence of acute-on-chronic heart failure, acute kidney injury, and mild transaminitis. He was transferred to the CICU for vasopressor support and diuresis, but remained in refractory shock despite escalating doses of dobutamine and norepinephrine. Impella CP was placed on HD2 for mechanical circulatory support, resulting in improved perfusion parameters. Complicated ICU course included delirium, mild GI bleed, and worsening anemia. He was weaned off Impella on HD5 and transitioned to oral heart failure regimen.

### **PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Decompensated HFrEF**  
- **Assessment:** Acute on chronic decompensation, likely precipitated by viral illness and medication nonadherence. Impella CP placed for temporary support.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue gentle diuresis (IV furosemide) as tolerated  
  - Titrate beta-blocker (metoprolol succinate) as hemodynamics allow  
  - Continue ACEi/ARB withheld due to AKI  
  - Daily echo to assess LV recovery  
  - Off Impella; close monitoring for recurrence  
  - Monitor for arrhythmias, volume status, and end-organ perfusion  
  - Cardiac rehab/PT consult

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (on CKD II)**  
- **Assessment:** Multifactorial: low perfusion, diuretics, nephrotoxic exposure (contrast). Improved with MCS.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Hold nephrotoxics  
  - Monitor daily BMP/renal panel  
  - Strict I/Os; avoid volume overload  
  - Nephrology following  
  - Renal function improving post-Impella

**3. Anemia**  
- **Assessment:** Chronic anemia, acutely worsened (Hgb nadir 7.2 g/dL), likely acute GI bleed (melena x 1), and dilutional from volume resuscitation.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor H/H q12hr  
  - GI consult - EGD deferred, high risk  
  - Transfused 1U PRBC on HD3  
  - Iron studies, retic count sent

**4. Prostate Cancer (s/p chemo, on leuprolide)**  
- **Assessment:** Metastatic CaP, no active complications.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue leuprolide  
  - Oncology following  
  - No acute intervention

**5. Hyperlipidemia**  
- **Assessment:** On simvastatin, LDL at goal.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue statin  
  - Monitor LFTs

**6. Opioid Use Disorder**  
- **Assessment:** On chronic opioids for cancer pain, at risk for withdrawal/delirium.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue home regimen  
  - Monitor for withdrawal, delirium  
  - Palliative care involved

**7. Delirium**  
- **Assessment:** Likely multifactorial: ICU, hypoperfusion, infection, medications, age.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Non-pharm interventions  
  - Minimize sedatives  
  - Family presence encouraged

**8. Infection**  
- **Assessment:** Recent viral pharyngitis/sinusitis, now resolved; no evidence of sepsis.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor for secondary infection  
  - No antibiotics at present

**9. Prediabetes**  
- **Assessment:** A1c 6.2%; no evidence of DKA/HHS.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor BG  
  - Continue lifestyle measures

**10. Other Issues**  
- DVT prophylaxis with heparin SQ  
- PPI for GI protection  
- Physical therapy for deconditioning  
- Advance care planning discussed with family

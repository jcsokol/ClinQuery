## Hospital Course Summary

**Admission HPI:**  
73 y.o. F with hx of HTN, DM2, metabolic syndrome, chronic sinusitis, and remote miscarriage, presented from home with 3 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and LE swelling. On arrival, hypotensive (SBP 78), tachycardic, hypoxic, with cool extremities. Lactate elevated. CXR: pulmonary edema. EKG: new-onset Afib with RVR. Echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, no valvular vegetations.

**ICU Course:**  
- Initial resuscitation with fluids, started on norepinephrine and dobutamine after MAPs <60 despite volume.
- Rapid escalation of vasopressors and persistent shock, lactic acidosis, anuric for 12h.
- Emergent insertion of a percutaneous left-sided heart pump (Impella CP) for mechanical circulatory support, with subsequent improvement in perfusion and urine output.
- Developed AKI (peak Cr 1.4), improved with diuresis and improved perfusion.
- Brief run of Afib with RVR, rate-controlled with amiodarone.
- Weaned off vasopressors by day 4.
- Extubated on 3/26/24, transitioned Impella to low support 3/27/24, removed 3/29/24.
- No evidence of infection, blood cultures negative. Mildly elevated LFTs, likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
- No new neuro deficits post-extubation.

## Assessment & Plan

### 1. Cardiogenic shock, acute decompensated heart failure, severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF 15%)
- Etiology: likely ischemic vs. hypertensive/diabetic cardiomyopathy.
- Required Impella CP for temporary mechanical support; now weaned.
- Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): low-dose carvedilol, start ACE-I once hemodynamically stable.
- Daily weights, strict I/O, monitor for volume overload.
- Cardiology to follow; consider advanced therapies if recurrent decompensation.

### 2. Acute kidney injury (resolving)
- Likely secondary to hypoperfusion; Cr peaked at 1.4, now 0.95.
- Renal function improving, continue to monitor.
- Avoid nephrotoxins, optimize volume status.

### 3. New-onset atrial fibrillation with RVR
- Rate controlled with amiodarone; no recurrence.
- Consider anticoagulation (CHA2DS2-VASc = 5).
- Monitor telemetry.

### 4. Diabetes mellitus type 2
- Admission A1c 6.9%.
- Continue sliding scale insulin, resume home regimen once PO.
- Monitor for hypoglycemia, especially post-extubation.

### 5. Hypertension
- Held anti-HTN agents during shock, resume as tolerated.
- Monitor for rebound hypertension.

### 6. Hypertriglyceridemia & metabolic syndrome
- Resume statin therapy.
- Dietitian consult for heart-healthy/diabetic diet.

### 7. Chronic sinusitis, recent viral sinusitis, hx strep pharyngitis
- No acute ENT symptoms.
- Continue PRN acetaminophen for sinus discomfort.
- No evidence for acute bacterial infection.

### 8. Diabetic neuropathy
- Continue gabapentin as home.
- PT/OT consult for mobility as able.

### 9. Miscellaneous
- VTE prophylaxis with LMWH.
- Family updated daily.
- Continue supportive care, monitor for complications (bleeding, infection, limb ischemia at Impella site).

## Medications (Current)

- Dobutamine (weaning)
- Amiodarone IV
- Insulin sliding scale
- Hydralazine PRN
- Acetaminophen 325 mg PO PRN
- Penicillin V potassium (completed for strep pharyngitis)
- Hydrocaholorothiazide 12.5 mg (held)
- Atorvastatin 40 mg qHS
- LMWH prophylaxis

---

**Next Steps:**  
- Continue weaning off inotropes, transition to oral heart failure therapy.
- Monitor labs, especially renal, hepatic, CBC.
- Evaluate for PT/OT, nutrition, social work for discharge planning.
- Cardiology to reassess for ICD/CRT needs prior to discharge.

### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever.  

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Francisco Haag is a 47 year old male with a history notable for acute bronchitis, recurrent viral pharyngitis, and remote right wrist fracture/subluxation, presenting to the ED with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, subjective fevers, and non-productive cough. He reported substernal chest pressure radiating to the jaw, associated with diaphoresis and nausea. On arrival, tachycardic to 132, BP 82/60, O2 sat 91% on 2L NC.  

Initial workup was notable for CXR with pulmonary edema, troponin 1.62, BNP 1882, and EKG with new LBBB. Echo revealed LVEF ~15%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR. He rapidly decompensated with worsening hypoxia, hypotension refractory to fluids/pressors, and was emergently intubated and transferred to the ICU. Due to ongoing cardiogenic shock and end-organ hypoperfusion, the decision was made to place a temporary left-sided heart pump (Impella CP) for mechanical circulatory support.  

He has required ongoing management for volume overload, AKI, and secondary infections.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN  

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (secondary to acute decompensated heart failure, likely viral myocarditis vs. ischemia)**
   - Impella CP placed ICU day 1, ongoing support, flows 3.2-3.5 L/min  
   - Weaning vasopressors, MAP goal >65  
   - Serial cardiac markers, daily echo  
   - Diuresis with IV furosemide  
   - Monitor for hemolysis (LDH, haptoglobin, plasma free Hgb), limb ischemia  
   - Daily labs, strict I/Os  
   - Plan: Consider Impella wean/removal if LVEF >35% and hemodynamics stable  

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (multifactorial: low perfusion, diuretics, contrast)**
   - Daily renal panel, monitor urine output  
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, adjust med dosing  
   - Renal consult if Cr >2.5 or oliguric  
   - Renal function improving as perfusion improves  

**3. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
   - Intubated, lung protective ventilation  
   - Daily CXR, ABG monitoring  
   - Weaning FiO2 as tolerated  
   - Pulmonary edema improving with diuresis  

**4. Secondary Bacterial Infection (possible VAP)**
   - Fevers, rising WBC, purulent secretions on day 2  
   - Started on empiric vanc/cefepime  
   - Blood/sputum cultures pending  
   - De-escalate abx per sensitivities  

**5. Pain Control**
   - Acetaminophen PRN, meperidine PRN  
   - Assess pain q4h, minimize sedatives as able  

**6. Nutrition**
   - NPO, started on tube feeds ICU day 2  
   - Monitor electrolytes, glycemic control  

**7. DVT Prophylaxis**
   - SCDs, SQ heparin  

**8. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis**
   - IV pantoprazole  

**9. Glycemic Management**
   - Insulin sliding scale, target BG <180  

**10. History of Wrist Fracture**
   - No current issues, ortho PRN

### ICU COURSE (BRIEF SUMMARY)  
- Day 1: Cardiac arrest x1, ROSC after 3min CPR. Impella placed.  
- Day 2: Improved hemodynamics, extubated briefly but reintubated for hypoxia.  
- Day 3: Weaning off pressors, urine output improving.  
- Day 4: LVEF improved, Impella flows reduced, planning for wean.  

---

### DISPOSITION/PLAN  
- Continue ICU monitoring, titrate support  
- Family updated daily  
- Await further improvement in cardiac/renal function for step-down

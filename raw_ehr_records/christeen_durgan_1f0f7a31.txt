### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Acute shortness of breath, chest heaviness, hypotension.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
50 y.o. female with PMHx notable for HTN, anemia, prediabetes, and chronic sinusitis presented via ED with acute-onset dyspnea, orthopnea, and near-syncope. She had been experiencing worsening fatigue and mild pedal edema for 2 weeks. On arrival, found to be tachypneic, hypotensive (BP 82/54), and hypoxic (O2 sat 88% RA). CXR revealed mild pulmonary edema; ECG showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T changes. Troponin I was mildly elevated at 0.11 ng/mL. TTE revealed severe global hypokinesis, LVEF ~15%, moderate MR. Patient progressed to cardiogenic shock requiring norepinephrine and subsequently was intubated for worsening hypoxia. Emergent left-sided Impella CP device was placed for hemodynamic support. No prior cardiac history. Denies CP prior to this event. No recent viral illness, no known drug use.

## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

- **Day 1:** Admitted in cardiogenic shock, started on norepi, rapidly intubated. Impella CP placed via femoral approach for refractory shock.
- **Day 2-3:** Gradual improvement in end-organ perfusion. Lactate trended down. Milrinone added for inotropy. Weaned norepi by day 3. Anemia worsened (likely dilutional/hemolysis from Impella). Mild transaminitis, likely ischemic.
- **Day 4:** Sedation weaned; following commands. Impella flows stable (3.2 L/min). Mild hemolysis (dark urine, LDH 392, haptoglobin low).
- **Day 5:** Extubated to HFNC. Renal function improved. Cardiology, CT surgery, and heart failure teams following.
- **Day 6:** Impella weaning trial planned. Hemodynamics stable.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, severe new-onset HFrEF (EF 15%), s/p Impella CP placement**  
- Likely idiopathic or viral myocarditis (workup pending).  
- Impella support ongoing, plan for weaning soon.  
- Continue inotropic support (milrinone).  
- Serial TTEs to assess recovery.  
- Monitor for device-related complications (hemolysis, limb ischemia, infection).  
- Cardiac MRI pending for myocarditis vs. other causes.

**2. Acute decompensated heart failure**  
- Diuresed with IV furosemide, daily weights, strict I/Os.  
- Electrolyte monitoring and repletion.  
- BNP trending.

**3. Acute kidney injury (resolved)**  
- Likely pre-renal, improved with restoration of perfusion.  
- Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins.

**4. Anemia (worsening, likely multifactorial: dilutional, hemolysis from pump, chronic)**  
- Monitor Hgb daily.  
- Consider transfusion if Hgb <7.5 or symptomatic.  
- Iron studies sent.

**5. Mild transaminitis**  
- Likely ischemic hepatitis.  
- Monitor LFTs, trend down.

**6. Hypertension (history, not currently hypertensive)**  
- Hold antihypertensives while on inotropes/Impella.

**7. Prediabetes**  
- Monitor glucose, no insulin required.

**8. Chronic sinusitis**  
- No acute symptoms; continue observation.

**9. OCP/IUD management**  
- Mirena IUD in situ, no acute issues; OCPs held in ICU.

**10. DVT prophylaxis**  
- SCDs in place, heparin SQ unless contraindicated.

**11. Nutrition, mobility, and disposition planning**  
- Enteral feeds on vent, now tolerating oral.  
- PT/OT consult for future rehab needs.

---

## TO DO / FOLLOW-UP

- Serial labs (CBC, chem, LFTs, hemolysis markers)
- Repeat TTE in 48h
- Monitor for infection/bleeding at Impella site
- Cardiac MRI when stable
- Social work for disposition planning

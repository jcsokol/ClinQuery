### **PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

---

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (Acute on Chronic Systolic HF, EF 20%)**  
- **Assessment:** Decompensated CHF with refractory hypotension, end-organ hypoperfusion, and evidence of multi-organ dysfunction. Required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for circulatory support.

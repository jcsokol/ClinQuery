ICU COURSE (Summary):  
Day 0: Admission s/p cardiac arrest, Impella CP placed, started on norepinephrine, IV antibiotics (pip/tazo, vanc), mechanical ventilation.  
Day 1: Weaned norepinephrine, improved MAP, decreasing lactate.  
Day 2: Extubated, neuro intact, Impella CP flows reduced.  
Day 3: Impella removed, transitioned to diuresis, weaned O2.  
Day 4-5: Mobilizing in bed, off pressors, tolerating oral intake, transitioned to oral abx.

PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

1. **Cardiogenic Shock s/p Cardiac Arrest**
   - Initial profound shock, LVEF 15%, Impella CP for LV support
   - Plan:  
     - Continue cardiac monitoring  
     - Daily echo, trend BNP/troponin  
     - Wean inotropes as tolerated  
     - Cardiology to follow, consider ICD evaluation
2. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
   - Plan:  
     - Diuresis (IV Lasix), monitor I/Os  
     - Daily weights, strict fluid restriction  
     - Monitor renal function, adjust diuretic dosing
3. **Sepsis (presumed, source unclear)**
   - Initial leukocytosis, fever, hypotension  
   - Plan:  
     - Continue IV abx x 7d, de-escalate if cultures negative  
     - Monitor for new infectious foci  
     - Daily CBC, lactate, cultures PRN
4. **History of Appendectomy (remote)**
   - No acute abdominal findings  
   - Plan:  
     - Continue routine wound care, monitor for infection
5. **Recurrent Viral Pharyngitis**
   - No current symptoms  
   - Plan:  
     - Supportive care PRN, monitor for new URI sx
6. **Gynecologic History (miscarriage, tubal pregnancy)**
   - Not currently pregnant; LMP 2 weeks ago  
   - Plan:  
     - Routine GYN follow-up outpatient
7. **Remote Laceration, Foot**
   - Well-healed, no signs infection  
   - Plan:  
     - No intervention needed

DISPOSITION:  
- Anticipate transfer to stepdown on 6/3/24 if stable  
- Cardiology, GYN, and Infectious Disease to follow  
- Anticoagulation to be considered on discharge

---

PROGRESS NOTE (ICU Day 4)

S: Patient alert, asking questions, denies chest pain, tolerating oral diet.  
O: Vitals stable, off pressors, UOP >0.5 mL/kg/hr. Labs stable.  
A/P: As above. Continue weaning support, anticipate transfer to stepdown.

---

Orders:  
- Furosemide 40 mg IV q12h  
- Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID  
- Continue abx for total 7 days

---

**CLINICAL SUMMARY:**  
Louvenia McClure, 35F, admitted for cardiogenic shock s/p cardiac arrest, required temporary LV support (Impella CP). Improved with supportive care, diuresis, and antibiotics. Plan for stepdown transfer and multidisciplinary follow-up.

HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:
Ed Connelly is a previously healthy 16-year-old male with a history of recent viral pharyngitis and bronchitis who presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He was found to be tachycardic (HR 128), hypotensive (BP 78/46), tachypneic (RR 28), and hypoxic (O2 sat 89% RA). Initial labs demonstrated elevated troponin I, BNP, and a mixed respiratory/metabolic acidosis. CXR showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Echo revealed severely reduced LVEF (~15%), LV dilation, and mild MR.

He was transferred to the PICU, started on milrinone and norepinephrine, and intubated for worsening hypoxia. Despite escalation, he developed worsening cardiogenic shock and multi-organ dysfunction. Decision was made for temporary mechanical circulatory support; an Impella CP was placed on hospital day 2 via right femoral approach with improvement in end-organ perfusion. He has since been managed with inotropes, diuresis, and supportive care. He remains intubated but is weaning off pressors. Serial echos show gradual improvement in LVEF (~28% on HD6). AKI is improving with diuresis.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
- Milrinone infusion 0.3 mcg/kg/min
- Norepinephrine 0.03 mcg/kg/min (weaning)
- Furosemide 20mg IV q12h
- Ceftriaxone 1g IV q24h (for possible secondary infection)
- Pantoprazole 20mg IV q24h
- Acetaminophen 325mg PO q6h PRN
- Amoxicillin 250mg PO BID (completed)
- Ibuprofen 100mg PO PRN (held)
- Heparin infusion (for Impella anticoagulation)
- Dextromethorphan/doxylamine solution (held)

ASSESSMENT & PLAN (Problem-based)

**1. Acute decompensated heart failure, severe LV dysfunction, presumed viral myocarditis**
- Initially presented with shock and multi-organ failure.
- Temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placed on HD2, providing circulatory support.
- LVEF improving on serial echo; now ~28%.
- Continue Impella support, goal to wean as tolerated over next 48-72h.
- Daily echo, monitor for hemolysis, device-related complications.
- Maintain MAP >65, adjust pressors/inotropes as needed.

**2. Cardiogenic shock**
- On norepinephrine and milrinone; weaning pressors as tolerated.
- Monitor perfusion, lactate, urine output.
- Continue close hemodynamic monitoring.

**3. Acute kidney injury (KDIGO Stage 2)**
- Likely secondary to hypoperfusion and congestion.
- Creatinine improved from 2.09 to 0.69; urine output now >1.5cc/kg/hr.
- Diuresis with furosemide; monitor lytes and volume status.

**4. Volume overload**
- Manifested as peripheral edema, pulmonary congestion.
- On IV furosemide, net negative fluid balance.
- Daily weights, strict I/O.

**5. Risk of infection**
- On ceftriaxone empirically; cultures negative to date.
- Monitor for fever, WBC, procalcitonin.
- Remove central lines ASAP.

**6. Mild transaminitis**
- Likely secondary to hypoperfusion ("shock liver").
- Downtrending AST/ALT.
- Monitor LFTs q48h.

**7. Respiratory failure**
- Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
- Weaning FiO2, currently on 0.3.
- Target extubation in 24-48h if stable.

**8. Pain control**
- Acetaminophen PRN; no opioids required.
- Pain score generally <3/10.

**9. Nutrition**
- NPO, receiving TPN.
- Plan for enteral feeds as tolerated.

**10. Psychosocial**
- Family updated daily; social work involved.

# HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Floy West is a 41-year-old female with a history of chronic hypertension and multiple prior pregnancies, presenting to the ED with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. She reports a prior miscarriage but otherwise normal pregnancies. No previous cardiac history except for long-standing HTN, which has been managed with HCTZ. No prior MI or known structural heart disease. No history of substance use. She became acutely short of breath at home, unable to lie flat, and was brought in by her spouse.

In the ED, she was tachycardic, hypertensive (BP 176/103), tachypneic, and hypoxic (SpO2 89% on RA). She was noted to have JVD, S3 gallop, and bilateral rales. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Troponin was elevated at 0.29 ng/mL. BNP 2130 pg/mL. EKG showed sinus tachycardia, no ST changes. She was started on IV furosemide and nitroglycerin.

She developed hypotension (SBP 78 mmHg) and worsening hypoxia requiring BiPAP. Bedside echo revealed severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, and moderate MR. She was transferred to the CICU for escalating shock and placed on norepinephrine and dobutamine. Due to persistent hypoperfusion and rising lactate (4.2 mmol/L), she underwent emergent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for temporary mechanical circulatory support.

# HOSPITAL COURSE

**5/12/2024 (Day 1):**  
Admitted to CICU for acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock. Started on furosemide, nitroglycerin, norepinephrine, and dobutamine. Worsening hypoperfusion, rising lactate, placed on Impella CP. Intubated for worsening hypoxia. Foley and arterial line placed. Initial labs notable for AKI (Cr 1.9, baseline 0.9), elevated troponin, high BNP.  

**5/13/2024 (Day 2):**  
Continued on Impella support, weaned off norepinephrine. Improved urine output after diuresis. Lactate trending down. Persistent LVEF ~15% on repeat TTE. Started on low-dose beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5mg q12h) and spironolactone.  

**5/14/2024 (Day 3):**  
Impella flows stable, no hemolysis. Weaning sedation. Extubated to high-flow nasal cannula. Marked improvement in volume status. Creatinine improving.  

**5/15/2024 (Day 4):**  
Impella removed. Remained hemodynamically stable on oral meds. Mobilized to chair. No further arrhythmias. Initiated GDMT (carvedilol uptitrated, sacubitril/valsartan started).  

**5/16/2024 (Day 5):**  
Transferred to telemetry. Stable off pressors and MCS. Discharge planning initiated.

# ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**41F with chronic HTN, acute decompensated HF with cardiogenic shock, required temporary LVAD (Impella), now improving.**

1. **Cardiogenic Shock, new severe LV systolic dysfunction**
   - Etiology: Non-ischemic, likely peripartum or hypertensive heart disease
   - Managed with inotropes (dobutamine), vasopressors (norepinephrine), then Impella CP
   - Now stable, Impella removed
   - Plan: Continue GDMT for HFrEF, monitor for arrhythmias, repeat TTE prior to discharge

2. **Acute decompensated Heart Failure**
   - IV diuresis, now euvolemic
   - Monitor weights, I/O, daily labs

3. **Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal)**
   - Multifactorial: cardiorenal, diuretics, hypoperfusion
   - Improved with volume status, Cr trending to baseline

4. **Hypertension**
   - Now controlled, transition to oral antihypertensives (carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone, HCTZ)
   - Close outpatient follow up

5. **History of normal pregnancies, prior miscarriage**
   - No active OB issues

6. **Contraception**
   - No current contraception, OB consult for options with new HF diagnosis

7. **DVT Prophylaxis**
   - SCDs, subQ heparin

8. **Other**
   - PT/OT for rehab
   - Social work for discharge planning

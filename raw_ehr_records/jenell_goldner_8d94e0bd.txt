MRN: 00499118-ICU  
DOB: 01/29/1942  
Sex: Female  
Admission Date: 06/01/2024  
Attending: Dr. F. Letourneau  
Consults: Cardiology, CV Surgery, Endocrinology, Hematology  
Location: MICU, Bed 17

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema over 2 weeks.  

---

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Ms. Goldner is an 82-year-old female with chronic systolic heart failure (EF 35%), h/o breast ca (s/p lumpectomy, remote), prediabetes, chronic anemia, and multiple remote miscarriages, who presented with acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock. She was found at home by family, confused and tachypneic, with increasing lower extremity swelling, productive cough, and recent viral URI. EMS noted hypotension (SBP 78 mmHg), HR 112, RR 28, O2 sat 89% RA. On arrival to the ED, she was in respiratory distress with bibasilar rales, JVD, and cool extremities. CXR: pulmonary edema. Echo: LVEF 31%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR, dilated LV.  

Despite IV diuresis, she developed worsening shock (MAP <60, lactate 4.2). Decision was made to place a percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support. She was transferred to MICU.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure / Cardiogenic Shock (EF 31%)**
- Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support, now removed  
- IV diuresis (furosemide drip, then IVP), transitioned to oral  
- Monitor for recurrent volume overload, daily weights, strict I/O  
- Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): Metoprolol, titrate as tolerated  
- Consider SGLT2i on discharge if renal fxn allows  
- Echo prior to discharge  
- Cardiac rehab referral  

### 2. **Chronic Systolic CHF**
- Continue beta blocker, ACEi/ARB deferred due to hypotension  
- Daily weights, low sodium diet  
- Cardiology f/u 1 week post-discharge  

### 3. **AKI, improved**
- Likely pre-renal from low output, diuresis  
- Renal fxn improving with euvolemia  
- Monitor BUN/Cr daily  
- Avoid nephrotoxins  

### 4. **Anemia (chronic, multifactorial)**
- Hgb stable ~10, no transfusion needed  
- Iron studies pending  
- Monitor for GI blood loss  

### 5. **Remote Malignancy (Breast CA)**
- No recurrence, completed treatment 1998  
- Routine age-appropriate cancer screening  

### 6. **Prediabetes**
- Continue lifestyle mod, monitor glucose  
- A1c 6.0% (from OSH records)  
- No insulin or PO agents needed at this time  

### 7. **Vascular Access Complication**
- RLE hematoma at Impella site, improving  
- Vascular Surgery: Conservative mgt, warm compress  
- Monitor for expansion, infection  

### 8. **Delirium, resolved**
- Likely multifactorial (shock, hypoxia, ICU stay)  
- Resolved; continue reorientation, optimize sleep, minimize restraints  

### 9. **Acute bronchitis/viral URI**
- Supportive care, no antibiotics  
- Symptoms improved  

### 10. **DVT Prophylaxis**
- SCDs, LMWH held during Impella; resumed post-removal  

### 11. **Physical Therapy/Discharge Planning**
- Ambulating with PT  
- Anticipate SNF placement for rehab

**MRN:** 009283471  
**DOB:** 07/01/1987

**HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY**

Ms. Farah Nolan is a 36-year-old female with a past medical history notable for obesity (BMI ~34), hypertension, anemia, seizure disorder (single event, likely situational), recurrent urinary tract infections, and a history of normal pregnancies. She presented to the Emergency Department on 5/22/2024 with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. She also reported intermittent non-radiating chest pain, and had a witnessed syncopal event at home prior to arrival.

On arrival, she was found to be tachycardic (HR 116), hypertensive (BP 172/98), febrile (38.1°C), and hypoxic (SpO2 89% on RA). Initial labs suggested a new acute decompensated heart failure with possible myocarditis, with evidence of multi-organ hypoperfusion. She was transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic monitoring, where she subsequently developed cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressors and temporary left-sided mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP, placed on hospital day 2).

**HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM**

---

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**  
- **Presentation:** Worsening SOB, LE edema, chest discomfort, syncope.  
- **ED findings:** Hypoxia, hypotension after initial hypertension, elevated JVP, S3.  
- **Echo:** LVEF 18%, global hypokinesis, mild MR, small pericardial effusion (no tamponade).  
- **Troponin I:** Peaked at 4.2 ng/mL (ref <0.04).  
- **BNP:** 1890 pg/mL (ref <100).  
- **Course:** Rapid clinical deterioration, required norepinephrine and dobutamine. Worsening lactic acidosis, oliguria.  
- **Interventions:**  
    - Impella CP placed via right femoral approach on HD2.  
    - IV diuresis (furosemide gtt), cautious after stabilization.  
    - Guideline-directed medical therapy for HF initiated after stabilization (low-dose carvedilol, spironolactone).  
- **Outcome:** Gradual improvement in end-organ perfusion. Impella weaned and explanted on HD6.  
- **Plan:** Continue aggressive HF management, cardiac MRI outpatient to further evaluate for myocarditis.

---

**2. Temporary LVAD (Impella CP) Placement**  
- **Indication:** Refractory cardiogenic shock, failed medical therapy.  
- **Course:**  
    - No device-related complications.  
    - Serial TTE showed improved LVEF to 34% on HD6.  
    - Vascular US: No DVT.  
- **Plan:**  
    - Weekly vascular checks.  
    - Anticoagulation (heparin infusion, then warfarin).  
    - Cardiology f/u, consider wearable defibrillator.

---

**3. Hypertension**  
- **Prior meds:** Amlodipine/HCTZ/Olmesartan, nonadherent.  
- **During admission:** Held during acute shock, now restarted at reduced doses.  
- **Plan:** Monitor BP, titrate as tolerated.

---

**4. Obesity**  
- **BMI:** 33.9  
- **Plan:** Nutritional counseling, referral to weight management post-discharge.

---

**5. Seizure disorder**  
- **No events this admission.**  
- **Plan:** Continue current anticonvulsant regimen, monitor for interactions.

---

**6. Acute Kidney Injury**  
- **Labs:** Cr peaked at 2.1 mg/dL (baseline 1.0).  
- **Etiology:** Pre-renal (hypoperfusion), possibly nephrotoxic meds.  
- **Course:** Improved with volume management, Cr down to 1.3 mg/dL.  
- **Plan:** Monitor, avoid nephrotoxins.

---

**7. Anemia**  
- **Baseline:** Hgb 11.2 g/dL, nadir 8.8 g/dL (HD3).  
- **Etiology:** Likely multifactorial (hemodilution, AKI, device).  
- **Plan:** Monitor, iron panel pending, no transfusion needed.

---

**8. Acute Viral Pharyngitis**  
- **Symptoms:** Resolved after supportive care.  
- **Plan:** No further interventions.

---

**9. UTI / Bronchitis / Streptococcal pharyngitis**  
- **No current evidence of infection.**  
- **Plan:** Monitor for recurrence.

---

**10. Contraceptive Management**  
- **Current:** NuvaRing, Errin, Camila (prior).  
- **Plan:** Discussed risk of estrogen-containing contraceptives with new heart failure; advised progestin-only method.

---

**11. Pain**  
- **Severity:** 3/10, musculoskeletal  
- **Plan:** PRN acetaminophen.

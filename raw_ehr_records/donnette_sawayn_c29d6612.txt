H&P / Admission Note
==================================================================

Chief Complaint:
"Shortness of breath, chest discomfort, and weakness for 2 days."

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Donnette Sawayn is a 67-year-old female with a history of obesity (BMI 30+), chronic migraine, and prior miscarriage, who presented to the ED with acute onset dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigue. She reported intermittent chest tightness and mild palpitations the day prior to admission, with worsening over the past 12 hours. No prior history of heart failure or CAD. She was recently treated in urgent care for acute bronchitis and viral pharyngitis (last episode 1 month ago). No recent travel, sick contacts, or known COVID exposure.

On arrival, she was tachypneic, mildly hypoxic (O2 sat 88% RA), tachycardic, and hypotensive (BP 82/54). She developed progressive respiratory distress and required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. Echocardiogram in the ED showed severely reduced LV systolic function (EF ~15%), with global hypokinesis, moderate MR, and RV dysfunction. Troponin mildly elevated. Emergent left heart cath showed non-obstructive CAD. Cardiac index by Swan-Ganz: 1.8 L/min/m2. She was started on pressors and inotropes for cardiogenic shock, and an Impella CP device was placed for temporary LV support.

Past Medical History:
- Obesity (BMI ~30)
- Chronic intractable migraine without aura
- Acute bronchitis and viral pharyngitis (resolved)
- Miscarriage (1st trimester, remote)
- Prior ankle sprain

Past Surgical History:
- None

Family History:
- Mother: HTN, DM2
- Father: MI at 68, deceased

Social History:
- Lives alone, retired teacher
- No tobacco, rare ETOH, no illicit drugs

Allergies:
- NKDA

Home Medications:
- Acetaminophen 325 mg PO PRN
- Naproxen sodium 220 mg PO PRN
- Acetaminophen/oxycodone 325/5 mg PO PRN

==================================================================
Hospital Course Summary
==================================================================
ICU Day 1-2: Cardiogenic shock, intubated/mechanically ventilated. Started on norepinephrine and dobutamine. Impella CP placed via femoral approach. Initial improvement in MAP and urine output. Serial troponin and BNP monitored. Started on empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone, azithromycin) for concern of pneumonia.

ICU Day 3: Weaned off norepinephrine, transitioned to milrinone. Impella flows ~3.0 L/min, LVEDP improved. Extubated to HFNC. Developed transient atrial fibrillation (rate controlled with IV metoprolol). Renal function stable.

ICU Day 5: Impella weaning per protocol, echo showed improved LV function (EF 30%). Mild transaminitis noted, likely ischemic hepatitis. Ongoing diuresis for volume overload.

ICU Day 7-9: Impella explanted, transitioned to GDMT (carvedilol, sacubitril-valsartan, spironolactone). Transferred to stepdown. Gradually advanced diet and mobility. Psychiatry consulted for anxiety. Discharge planning initiated.

==================================================================
Problem-Based Assessment & Plan
==================================================================
1. **Cardiogenic Shock, new onset severe LV dysfunction**
   - Etiology likely viral myocarditis vs. stress-induced (Takotsubo) vs. unrecognized ischemic insult.
   - Temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP) for 7 days, now explanted.
   - Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF.
   - Monitor for recurrent arrhythmias, volume overload, end-organ dysfunction.

2. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, s/p intubation**
   - Now extubated, on room air.
   - Daily CXR, aggressive pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry.

3. **Volume Overload**
   - Ongoing IV diuresis, transitioned to oral furosemide.
   - Monitor daily weights, I/O, BMP.

4. **Atrial Fibrillation, transient**
   - Rate controlled, no recurrence.
   - No anticoagulation indicated (CHA2DS2-VASc=2, bleeding risk high during Impella).

5. **Mild Transaminitis**
   - Likely ischemic hepatitis vs. drug-induced (acetaminophen use).
   - Monitor LFTs daily, trend downtrending.

6. **Obesity**
   - Nutrition consult, low sodium/cardiac diet.

7. **Chronic Migraine**
   - No acute headaches during admission. Continue home PRN regimen.

8. **History of miscarriage, prior viral pharyngitis/bronchitis, remote ankle sprain**
   - No acute issues.

9. **Psychosocial**
   - Anxiety re: new HF diagnosis and ICU stay.
   - Psychiatry involved, supportive therapy.

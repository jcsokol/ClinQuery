## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**Sanda Wolff** is a 66-year-old woman with a past medical history notable for hypertension, diabetes (on insulin and metformin), stage 1 CKD, obesity, COPD, metabolic syndrome, osteoarthritis, and hypertriglyceridemia, who presented to the ED with worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and confusion. She was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with hypotension and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. She subsequently developed cardiogenic shock requiring ICU admission and the placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2.

Her hospital course was complicated by acute on chronic kidney injury, labile blood glucose, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. She was weaned off temporary mechanical circulatory support on HD6 and extubated on HD7. She continued to improve with aggressive diuresis, glycemic control, and pulmonary toilet. She was transferred to stepdown on HD11.

# ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
- **HPI:** Presented with AMS, hypotension, cold extremities, lactate 4.2, echo EF 15%, severe global hypokinesis, no acute MI.
- **Course:** Required norepinephrine, dobutamine, and then Impella CP for mechanical support (HD2→HD6).
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): carvedilol, sacubitril-valsartan, spironolactone as tolerated.
  - Monitor for arrhythmia, volume status.
  - Cardiology following for transplant/LVAD candidacy.
  - Daily weights, strict I/Os.
  - Telemetry.

### 2. Diabetes Mellitus, poorly controlled
- **HPI:** A1c 8.4% on admission, recurrent hyperglycemia in ICU (BG 180–320).
- **Course:** Insulin drip transitioned to glargine + aspart, resumed metformin when stable.
- **Plan:**  
  - Endocrine consult for insulin regimen.
  - Continue BG checks q6h.
  - Hold metformin if Cr >1.5.
  - Dietician consult.

### 3. Hypertension
- **HPI:** Home HCTZ, BP on admission 85/52, now 110–130/60–75.
- **Plan:**  
  - Restart antihypertensives as tolerated.
  - Monitor for orthostasis.

### 4. Chronic Kidney Disease, stage 1 + Acute Kidney Injury
- **HPI:** Baseline Cr 1.2, peaked at 2.3 on HD3, now trending down (Cr 1.5 HD10).
- **Plan:**  
  - Avoid nephrotoxins.
  - Nephrology following.
  - Monitor daily CMP, urine output.

### 5. COPD
- **HPI:** Home Advair, O2 requirement 2L NC, FEV1/FVC 43%.
- **Course:** Intubated HD2–HD7 for respiratory failure, treated for VAP (piperacillin-tazobactam).
- **Plan:**  
  - Pulmonary toilet.
  - Wean O2 as tolerated.
  - PFTs after discharge.

### 6. Obesity, Metabolic Syndrome, Hypertriglyceridemia
- **Plan:**  
  - Low sodium, low carb, cardiac diet.
  - Nutritionist consult.
  - Monitor lipids.

### 7. Osteoarthritis (hand)
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue naproxen prn if renal function stable.
  - PT/OT consult.

### 8. Recent acute viral pharyngitis/sinusitis (resolved)
- **Plan:**  
  - Symptomatic care as needed.

### 9. Pregnancy (history only, not currently pregnant)
- **Plan:**  
  - Contraception reviewed (Mirena in situ, no issues).

## SUBJECTIVE

47F with h/o HTN, prediabetes, anemia, prior miscarriage, and recent acute bronchitis, presenting after 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest tightness. Developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and was transferred from OSH. Now s/p placement of temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock secondary to acute decompensated heart failure.  

She reports mild incisional pain (3/10), some anxiety. Denies new chest pain, palpitations, or fevers. Still feels weak. Appetite poor.

#### OTHER LABS

- **Troponin I:**  
    - 5/14: 0.08 → 0.09 ng/mL (peak, non-dx for MI)
- **BNP:**  
    - 5/14: 1680 pg/mL (elevated)

#### MICROBIOLOGY

---

## IMAGING

- **CXR 5/14:** Pulmonary edema, mild cardiomegaly, vascular congestion.
- **Echo (5/14):** LVEF 18%, global hypokinesis, mild MR, RV mild dysfunction. No LV thrombus.  
- **Echo (5/17):** Impella in place, LVEF 23%, improved filling pressures.

---

## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

- Admitted for acute decompensated HF with shock (likely ischemic, h/o HTN, DM risk).
- Rapidly progressive cardiogenic shock, hypotension refractory to inotropes/pressors.
- Temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placed in cath lab on 5/14.
- Gradual improvement in perfusion, end-organ function, weaned off vasopressors 5/16.
- Ongoing diuresis for volume overload, transitioned from IV to PO diuretics.
- No arrhythmias or device complications.
- Anemia managed conservatively, no transfusion required.
- No infectious complications.
- Physical therapy initiated 5/17.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic shock, s/p Impella CP placement (5/14):**  
  - Etiology: Likely ischemic/HTN-induced cardiomyopathy; no acute coronary occlusion.
  - Monitoring: Daily device assessment, hemodynamics, echo.
  - Plan: Continue Impella support, daily weaning eval. Plan for device removal if stable off pressors for >48h.
  - Anticoagulation: Continue heparin per device protocol.
  - Cardiology, CT surgery following.

**2. Acute decompensated HF, reduced EF:**  
  - IV diuresis transitioned to PO furosemide.
  - Monitor weight, I/Os, renal fxn.
  - Goal: euvolemia, optimize guideline-directed medical therapy as tolerated.

**3. Anemia (chronic, mild):**  
  - Hgb stable, likely multifactorial (chronic dz, dilutional).
  - Iron studies pending; folate, B12 wnl.
  - No transfusion needed.

**4. Prediabetes:**  
  - Glucose controlled, no insulin needed.
  - Monitor A1c, dietary education.

**5. Hypertension:**  
  - Hold anti-HTN agents while on Impella/pressors; resume as tolerated.
  - BP now stable, resume amlodipine/olmesartan combo today.

**6. VTE prophylaxis:**  
  - On heparin for device.

**7. Infection prevention:**  
  - Daily line care, monitor WBC/temp.
  - No signs infection.

**8. Physical deconditioning:**  
  - PT/OT.

**9. Contraceptive management:**  
  - Mirena IUD in place, no acute gyn issues.
  - Continue home regimen, no changes.

**10. Psychosocial:**  
  - Anxiety, supportive care, social work consult.

---

## DISPOSITION

- Remain in ICU for ongoing Impella support.
- Anticipate transfer to step-down if device removed and stable for 24-48h.
- Cardiology, CT surgery, PT/OT, social work following.

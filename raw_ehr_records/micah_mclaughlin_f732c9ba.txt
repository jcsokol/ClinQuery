### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest discomfort  
Admitted from ED for acute decompensated heart failure, required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placement on HD #2 for cardiogenic shock

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Micah McLaughlin is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obesity, gout, and baseline functional class II who presented with 3 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity swelling. He also reported a viral upper respiratory infection 1 week prior, with persistent sinus congestion and sore throat. He was initially managed with diuretics for presumed HF exacerbation, but rapidly developed hypotension, rising lactate, and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. Cardiology was consulted; an echocardiogram revealed new severe global LV dysfunction (EF 15%). He was transferred to the CICU where he developed cardiogenic shock (SBP 70s, CI 1.6, rising creatinine/lactate). Impella CP was placed on HD #2 for hemodynamic support.

Course complicated by AKI, transaminitis, and persistent volume overload. No arrhythmias. Required pressors x24h, now off. Extubated HD #3. Diuresis ongoing. Gout flare on HD #4 managed with colchicine. Infectious workup for viral myocarditis (pending).

*ALT/AST only checked on HD #2-#4 for transaminitis.  
Troponin and BNP trended daily, peaking on HD #2.  
Some values missing due to hemolyzed samples.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN (Problem-Oriented)

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Acute Heart Failure (presumed viral myocarditis)
- Required temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP) on HD #2
- Now weaning off pressors, Impella flows decreased as tolerated
- EF improving on support; plan TTE daily
- Cardiology/Heart Failure following
- Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) as tolerated
- Monitor for arrhythmias, end-organ perfusion, hemolysis

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (multifactorial: low perfusion, diuretics)
- Cr peaked 1.92, trending down with improved MAP/volume status
- Avoid nephrotoxins, monitor UOP/labs q12h
- Consider nephrology if no improvement

### 3. Transaminitis
- ALT/AST peaked HD #2, now downtrending
- Likely ischemic hepatitis from shock
- Monitor LFTs

### 4. Gout flare (HD #4)
- Acute monoarticular pain/swelling L 1st MTP
- Treated with colchicine, continue allopurinol
- Avoid NSAIDs due to AKI

### 5. Obesity, Hypertension, Dyslipidemia
- Resume home antihypertensives as tolerated
- Continue statin
- Dietician consult for weight management

### 6. Viral URI (rhinovirus)
- Supportive care
- No evidence of secondary bacterial infection

### 7. DVT prophylaxis
- SCDs, SQ heparin

### 8. Disposition
- Remain in CICU
- Will consider transfer to step-down once off Impella and stable

---

### NURSING/OTHER
- Foley DCâ€™d HD #5, ambulation with PT
- Daily weights, strict I&O
- Central line (R IJ), A-line (R radial) in place

# History of Present Illness

36-year-old male with PMH of viral sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and recent pharyngitis who presented to the ED with 3 days of severe dyspnea, orthopnea, and progressive lower extremity edema. Initial workup notable for hypotension, hypoxia, elevated troponin, and new onset reduced LVEF (EF 18%) on echo. Influenza B PCR positive. Patient deteriorated rapidly, requiring intubation and vasopressor support. Due to worsening shock and end-organ hypoperfusion, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 2.  

Medications on admission: acetaminophen, astemizole, epinephrine auto-injector (home med, not used in hospital).

# Hospital Course Summary

- **Day 1:** Admitted MICU for presumed viral myocarditis. Initial labs with leukocytosis, mild transaminitis, AKI (Cr 1.7). Echo: global hypokinesis, EF 18%, mild MR.
- **Day 2:** Developed refractory hypotension, rising lactate. Initiated norepinephrine, dobutamine. Worsening renal and hepatic indices. Impella CP placed via femoral approach. Hemodynamics improved.
- **Day 3-5:** Gradual improvement in perfusion, weaned off vasopressors. Persistent AKI, started on CRRT. Extubated on HD 4.
- **Day 6-7:** Impella weaned and explanted. Renal function recovering. Transaminitis resolving.  
- **Day 8-present:** Mobilizing with PT. Renal function near baseline. Off pressors/inotropes.

# Problem-Based Assessment and Plan

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock, s/p Influenza B Myocarditis, Impella CP  
- Initial presentation with fulminant myocarditis, rapidly progressive shock.  
- Impella CP placed HD 2 for mechanical circulatory support, explanted HD 6.  
- Now hemodynamically stable, off all pressors/inotropes.  
- **Plan:** Continue cardiac monitoring, daily TTE; guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF to be initiated as tolerated. Cardiology f/u.  

## 2. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO Stage 2), multifactorial  
- Likely secondary to low cardiac output and vasopressor use.  
- Required temporary CRRT HD 3-6, now off. UOP improving.  
- **Plan:** Monitor daily lytes, Cr, strict I/O, nephrology consult. Avoid nephrotoxins.  

## 3. Acute Liver Injury  
- Transaminitis (AST/ALT peak 304/210) likely from shock liver. Downtrending now.  
- **Plan:** Monitor LFTs, supportive care.  

## 4. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure  
- Intubated HD 2-4 for hypoxia, likely multifactorial (pulmonary edema, myocarditis, possible aspiration).  
- Extubated HD 4, on 2L NC O2. CXR: improving vascular congestion.  
- **Plan:** Pulmonary toilet, IS, wean O2.  

## 5. Deconditioning  
- Prolonged ICU stay with bedrest.  
- **Plan:** PT/OT daily, nutrition optimization.  

## 6. Viral Sinusitis/Bronchitis/Pharyngitis  
- No current evidence of ongoing infection.  
- **Plan:** Supportive care, monitor for secondary bacterial infection.  

## 7. Other  
- DVT ppx (SCDs, heparin sq), stress ulcer ppx (PPI), bowel regimen, glycemic control, VTE risk assessment daily.  
- Home meds reviewed; astemizole held due to QTc prolongation risk.

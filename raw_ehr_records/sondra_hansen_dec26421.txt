**[EPIC EHR NOTE â€“ ICU Admission]**

**Patient Name:** Sondra Hansen  
**MRN:** 00322914  
**DOB:** 04/02/1972 (Age: 52)  
**Sex:** Female  
**Date of Admission:** 04/18/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. Rachel K. Simmons  
**Consults:** Cardiology, ICU, Nephrology  

---

### **CHIEF COMPLAINT**
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.  

---

### **HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY**
Ms. Hansen, a 52-year-old female with a history notable for chronic sinusitis, anemia, prior eclampsia, and multiple respiratory infections, presented to the ED with a 2-week history of worsening exertional dyspnea, new-onset orthopnea, and bilateral leg swelling. She was found to be hypoxic (O2 sat 86% RA), tachycardic, and hypotensive on arrival. Initial workup revealed acute decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF 20%), likely ischemic in etiology. She developed cardiogenic shock refractory to inotropes and vasopressors, requiring placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2.  

Her hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury, anemia, and labile blood pressures. She required intensive monitoring, diuresis, and serial laboratory assessments. She was weaned off the Impella after 5 days, transitioned to guideline-directed medical therapy, and is currently stable on the floor.

## **PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (HFrEF, EF 20%)**  
- **Assessment:** Presented in shock; profound LV dysfunction, likely ischemic.  
- **Course:** Required Impella CP for 5 days; weaned off after hemodynamics stabilized.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue GDMT: carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone  
  - Daily weights, strict I/O, continue low-salt diet  
  - Cardiology f/u, consider ICD placement  
  - Monitor for arrhythmias  

### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury (on CKD 2)**  
- **Assessment:** Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, diuretics, contrast.  
- **Course:** Creatinine peaked at 2.1, now trending down.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Renal dosing of meds  
  - Monitor labs qAM  
  - Avoid further nephrotoxins  
  - Nephrology follow-up  

### 3. **Anemia (multifactorial, chronic + acute)**  
- **Assessment:** Hgb dropped to 8.6 (baseline ~11).  
- **Plan:**  
  - Iron studies, B12, folate pending  
  - 1 unit PRBCs given on HD 3  
  - Monitor for GI blood loss  

### 4. **Hypertension / Labile Blood Pressure**  
- **Assessment:** Fluctuations due to inotrope weaning, volume shifts.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Titrate antihypertensives as tolerated  
  - Monitor for hypotension  

### 5. **Chronic Sinusitis / Recent Viral URI**  
- **Assessment:** No evidence of ongoing infection; supportive care only.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Nasal saline, acetaminophen PRN  
  - Monitor for secondary bacterial infection  

### 6. **Antepartum Eclampsia (remote)**  
- **Assessment:** History only, not contributing to current course.  
- **Plan:**  
  - No action required  

### 7. **Medication Reconciliation**  
- **Assessment:** Multiple OCPs, no current contraceptive use.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Hold estrogen-containing OCPs due to cardiac risk  
  - Review necessity of other meds  

### 8. **VTE Prophylaxis**  
- **Plan:**  
  - SCDs in place  
  - Heparin SQ unless contraindicated by platelets/bleeding  

### 9. **Nutrition**  
- **Assessment:** Mildly malnourished, decreased oral intake in ICU.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Nutrition consult  
  - High-protein, low-salt diet  
  - Monitor prealbumin

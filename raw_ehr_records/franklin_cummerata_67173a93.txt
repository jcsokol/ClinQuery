## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**Chief Complaint:**  
Acute shortness of breath, chest pain, and altered mental status.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. Franklin Cummerata is a 35-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic syndrome who presented to the ED with acute onset chest discomfort, dyspnea, and confusion. On arrival, he was tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic. Initial labs notable for hyperglycemia, mild renal dysfunction, and metabolic acidosis. ECG showed ST depressions in V2-V4, troponin elevated, CXR with pulmonary edema. He rapidly deteriorated requiring transfer to the ICU for escalating vasopressor support and intubation.  
On hospital day 1, he developed refractory cardiogenic shock. A left-sided temporary percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) was placed emergently for hemodynamic support. Over the subsequent days, he had gradual improvement and was weaned from vasopressors, extubated on day 4, and Impella removed on day 5.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Systolic Heart Failure**
   - Severe LV dysfunction (EF 22%) likely due to silent MI in setting of metabolic syndrome.
   - Required emergent placement of temporary LVAD (Impella CP).
   - Now off vasopressors, Impella removed, improving end-organ function.
   - **Plan:** Continue close monitoring, telemetry, start guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF, cardiac rehab consult, consider outpatient coronary angiography for definitive diagnosis.

### 2. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
   - Due to pulmonary edema from heart failure.
   - Required intubation and mechanical ventilation, now extubated.
   - **Plan:** Diuresis as tolerated, oxygen support PRN, monitor for recurrent respiratory distress.

### 3. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Poorly Controlled**
   - Admission HbA1c 8.2%, frequent hyperglycemia during ICU stay.
   - **Plan:** Endocrine consult, initiate basal-bolus insulin, diabetes education, transition to subq insulin.

### 4. **Metabolic Syndrome, Hypertriglyceridemia**
   - Triglycerides elevated, LDL high, low HDL.
   - **Plan:** Start high-intensity statin, consider fenofibrate, dietary consult.

### 5. **Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**
   - Likely secondary to hypoperfusion; creatinine normalized.
   - **Plan:** Renal function monitoring, avoid nephrotoxins.

### 6. **Electrolyte Abnormalities**
   - Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia episodes during diuresis.
   - **Plan:** Electrolyte repletion as needed, daily labs.

### 7. **Critical Illness**
   - ICU-acquired weakness, risk for delirium.
   - **Plan:** Early mobilization, PT/OT, minimize sedation.

### 8. **Secondary Prevention**
   - No prior CAD history, now high risk.
   - **Plan:** Aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, ACEi/ARB, counseling on smoking/alcohol, outpatient follow-up.

## DISCHARGE PLANNING

- Anticipate transfer to step-down unit in 1-2 days if stable.
- Close follow-up with Cardiology, Endocrinology, and Primary Care.
- Emphasis on medication compliance, lifestyle modification.
- Outpatient echo and stress test in 4-6 weeks.

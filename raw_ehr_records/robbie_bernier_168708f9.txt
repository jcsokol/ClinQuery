## ICU Course Summary

Upon arrival, patient was in frank cardiogenic shock with evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion (confusion, cool extremities, lactate 4.6). Initial echo revealed severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, and moderate mitral regurg. Troponin I peaked at 4.3 ng/mL. He was started on dobutamine and norepinephrine. Despite escalating support, he remained hypotensive with worsening renal function and rising lactate. A decision was made to place a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for temporary circulatory support. 

Patient stabilized hemodynamically post-Impella, with improvement in end-organ perfusion. Over the next 72 hours, he was gradually weaned off vasopressors. After 5 days, the device was explanted. He was transitioned to guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure and initiated on diuresis. Anemia worsened transiently, likely dilutional and iatrogenic, but stabilized with supportive care.

## Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

### 1. Acute Decompensated Systolic Heart Failure / Cardiogenic Shock  
- Initial presentation with low-output state, hypotension, end-organ hypoperfusion.
- Severe LV dysfunction (echo LVEF 15%).
- Required inotropes (dobutamine), vasopressors (norepi), and temporary mechanical support (Impella CP) for 5 days.
- Serial improvement in hemodynamics and end-organ function.
- Plan: Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF (carvedilol, sacubitril-valsartan, dapagliflozin, spironolactone titrated as tolerated), close cardiology follow-up, consider advanced therapies if recurrent decompensation.

### 2. Anemia, multifactorial (chronic + dilutional/ICU-related)  
- Baseline anemia, worsened during ICU stay (lowest Hgb 10.0).
- No evidence of active bleeding.
- Plan: Iron studies, continue supportive care, avoid unnecessary phlebotomy, monitor for improvement as diuresis continues.

### 3. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, improved)  
- Initial Cr 2.1 (baseline 1.1), improved to 1.0 with improved perfusion.
- Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal dosing.

### 4. Prediabetes  
- Glucose ranged 68-104.
- HbA1c 6.2% on admission.
- Plan: Continue monitoring, diabetic diet, education.

### 5. Volume Overload/Edema  
- Improved with diuresis post-cardiac support.
- Plan: Daily weights, strict I/Os, continue loop diuretic as tolerated.

### 6. Viral Sinusitis (recent, resolved)  
- No current symptoms.
- No antibiotics indicated.

### 7. Remote Ankle Sprain  
- No acute issues.

### 8. Pain (mild, musculoskeletal)  
- Well-controlled on PRN naproxen.

### 9. Secondary Prevention  
- Statin initiated, smoking counseling (N/A), cardiac rehab referral, vaccinations up to date.

## Discharge Planning

- Anticipated discharge to home with spouse.

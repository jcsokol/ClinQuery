### **Hospital Course (ICU Admission)**

Mr. Ricky Zieme is a 59-year-old male, with a history of chronic sinusitis, prediabetes, anemia, and recent diagnosis of a colonic polyp, who presented to the ED with progressive exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest discomfort over 3 days. In the ED, he was tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic. Initial troponin was elevated. ECG showed new LBBB. Echo revealed severe global LV hypokinesis with EF ~20%. He rapidly developed cardiogenic shock (SCAI C), requiring transfer to the CICU, initiation of vasopressors, and urgent placement of a left-sided temporary ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

His course was complicated by acute kidney injury, anemia, and transient liver enzyme elevation. He was weaned off the Impella on hospital day 5 after myocardial recovery was demonstrated. He required diuresis, aggressive medical management for heart failure, and close monitoring of labs.

### **Active Problems (A/P)**

#### 1. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure / Cardiogenic Shock**
- **Assessment:** Severe new-onset systolic dysfunction (EF 20%). Cardiogenic shock requiring temporary LVAD (Impella CP). Etiology likely ischemic—awaiting formal cath.
- **Plan:**
  - Continue GDMT for HF (metoprolol, low-dose ACEi as tolerated, spironolactone).
  - Wean off IV inotropes/pressors as tolerated.
  - Monitor volume status and daily weights.
  - Repeat TTE after Impella explant.
  - Schedule cardiac catheterization.

#### 2. **Temporary LVAD (Impella) Placement, Day 0-5**
- **Assessment:** Required for shock, now explanted.
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor for vascular complications, hemolysis.
  - Serial LDH, haptoglobin, and free Hgb.
  - Neurovascular checks q4h for 48h post-explant.
  - Anticoagulation held 24h post-explant.

#### 3. **Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO Stage 1)**

#### 4. **Anemia (Chronic, worsened acutely)**
- **Assessment:** Baseline mild anemia, acute drop to Hgb nadir 8.7 g/dL on HD2. No overt bleeding.
- **Plan:**
  - Daily CBC.
  - Iron studies, retic count, haptoglobin, LDH.
  - Transfuse PRBCs if Hgb <7.5 or symptomatic.

#### 5. **Prediabetes**
- **Assessment:** HbA1c 6.4%. No evidence DKA/HHS.
- **Plan:**
  - FS glucose q6h while inpatient.
  - Low-carb diet.
  - Outpatient DM education.

#### 6. **Chronic Sinusitis, Recent Viral URI**
- **Assessment:** Mild symptoms on admission, no current fevers.
- **Plan:**
  - Continue fluticasone as outpatient.
  - Supportive care only.

#### 7. **Colon Polyp (10mm, recently resected)**
- **Assessment:** Path pending, no evidence of GI bleeding.
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor Hgb.
  - GI follow-up after discharge.

#### 8. **Other (Remote rotator cuff injury, laceration, first-degree burn)**
- **Assessment:** No acute issues.
- **Plan:**  
  - None required.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Cory Koss is a 19-year-old male with a past medical history notable for whiplash injury to the neck, viral sinusitis, acute viral pharyngitis, and a remote wrist fracture/subluxation. He presented to the Emergency Department 5 days ago with a 3-day history of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations. He also reported intermittent chest discomfort, low-grade fevers, and malaise. On arrival, he was tachycardic and hypotensive, with evidence of low cardiac output and early end-organ hypoperfusion (cool extremities, mild confusion). 

Initial workup was significant for elevated troponin, BNP, and transaminitis. CXR revealed pulmonary edema. Echocardiogram demonstrated severely reduced LV systolic function (EF 18%), global hypokinesis, and mild RV dysfunction. He was admitted to the MICU for acute decompensated heart failure, suspected myocarditis. Within 12 hours of admission, he developed worsening hypotension unresponsive to escalating doses of norepinephrine and dobutamine. Emergent placement of a percutaneous temporary LV assist device (Impella CP) was performed at bedside for cardiogenic shock.

He has since been managed in the ICU with ongoing hemodynamic monitoring, diuresis, inotropes, and supportive care. His course has been complicated by transient AKI and mild transaminitis, but he is now beginning to improve.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock (Myocarditis, Parvovirus B19)
- Required Impella CP for hemodynamic support (now removed)
- Weaned off inotropes, improving LV function
- Continue HF regimen (metoprolol, lisinopril, furosemide)
- Monitor for arrhythmia, end-organ recovery
- Cardiology f/u, consider cardiac MRI as outpatient

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (Improved)
- Likely ischemic/low-flow, now resolving
- Monitor renal function, maintain euvolemia
- Avoid nephrotoxins

### 3. Transaminitis/Shock Liver
- Likely secondary to hypoperfusion/CHF
- Trending down, monitor LFTs

### 4. Volume Overload/Pulmonary Edema
- Diuresis with IV furosemide, now euvolemic
- Daily weights, strict I/Os

### 5. Pain (Neck/Wrist)
- PRN acetaminophen/ibuprofen, avoid NSAIDs if renal function worsens
- PT/OT evaluating

### 6. Nutrition/Functional Status
- Diet advanced as tolerated
- Early mobilization with PT/OT

### 7. Infection
- Empiric antibiotics d/c’d after negative cultures and viral PCRs
- Monitor for secondary infection

### 8. DVT Prophylaxis
- SCDs in place, heparin SQ

### 9. Disposition
- Anticipate transfer to step-down in 24-48h if stable

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Shortness of breath, chest pain, and syncope at home.

## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Ms. Lottie Cole is a 39-year-old female with a history of prediabetes, anemia, and recent normal pregnancy (G4P4), who presented to the ED with acute onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and near-syncope. She was found to be tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic. Given her recent postpartum state (delivered 8 weeks ago), peripartum cardiomyopathy was suspected. TTE in the ED revealed an LVEF of 20%, severe global hypokinesis, and mild MR. She developed acute pulmonary edema and required intubation, vasopressors, and was transferred to the ICU. Due to refractory cardiogenic shock, she underwent emergent placement of a percutaneous left-sided heart pump (Impella CP) on hospital day 2.

She has since had a complicated ICU course including AKI (now resolving), transient liver injury, anemia requiring transfusion, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. She is now extubated, on minimal pressor support, and the Impella is being weaned.

   - Serial TTEs, Impella wean ongoing
   - Goal: Recovery of native function, bridge to recovery or advanced therapies if no improvement
   - Monitor for arrhythmias, anticoagulation per protocol

### 2. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
   - Intubated for pulmonary edema; extubated HD5
   - Now on 2L NC, sat >98%
   - CXR improved
   - Pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry

### 3. **Hospital-acquired Pneumonia**
   - Klebsiella pneumoniae, responsive to cefepime (completed 7d course)
   - Afebrile, WBC trending down, CXR improved

### 4. **Acute Kidney Injury**
   - Multifactorial (low perfusion, diuretics, sepsis)
   - Peak Cr 2.1, now 0.9
   - UOP >0.5 mL/kg/hr, IV fluids adjusted

### 5. **Transaminitis**
   - Shock liver, AST/ALT peaked, now normalized

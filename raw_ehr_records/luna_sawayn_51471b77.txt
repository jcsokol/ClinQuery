# ICU Progress Note

**Subjective:**  
Patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of T2DM, obesity, metabolic syndrome, seizure disorder, chronic sinusitis, anemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and neuropathy who was admitted for acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock. She initially presented to the ED with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. She also reported intermittent chest tightness and increased fatigue. Her medical history is notable for poorly controlled diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and a prior single episode of seizure (on AEDs).  

On hospital day 2, she developed hypotension refractory to fluids and escalating vasopressors, with rising lactate and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. She was transferred to the MICU and a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed emergently for cardiogenic shock secondary to presumed acute on chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy.

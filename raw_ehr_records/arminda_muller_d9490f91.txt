## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Ms. Arminda Muller is a 55-year-old female with a PMHx notable for prediabetes, recurrent sinusitis, prior miscarriage, and previous normal pregnancy, who presented with acute onset dyspnea, chest pain, and hypotension. She was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) with cardiogenic shock and ultimately required temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP placed on HD2) for refractory hypotension and low cardiac output.

She was transferred to the MICU on vasopressors and inotropes, subsequently stabilized, and had her temporary LV assist device weaned and explanted on HD6. Her hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury, transient transaminitis, and a lower respiratory tract infection.

## HPI

55F with prediabetes, prior 1st trimester miscarriage, and history of sinusitis, presented with 2 days of progressive SOB, orthopnea, and pleuritic chest pain. On arrival was hypotensive, tachycardic, hypoxic; CXR: bilateral pulmonary edema. Echo: severe global hypokinesis, LVEF ~15%, no valvular vegetations. Required intubation and pressor support. Emergent placement of Impella CP for cardiogenic shock refractory to medical therapy. No preceding viral prodrome. Denied recent travel, sick contacts.

## PROBLEM BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Severe Systolic HF**
   - Etiology unclear; ischemic vs. non-ischemic. No MI on serial troponins. Severe LVEF reduction.
   - Required Impella CP for mechanical support HD2-6
   - Dobutamine and norepinephrine weaned off by HD4
   - Serial lactates trended down (see above)
   - Plan: Continue GDMT, optimize euvolemia, consider ICD if EF persists <35% at 3mo, outpatient HF clinic f/u

### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO Stage II)**
   - Likely multifactorial: cardiorenal, vasopressors, transient hypotension
   - Peak Cr 1.8, now improved
   - Plan: IV fluids as tolerated, avoid nephrotoxins, monitor renal function

### 3. **Transaminitis**
   - AST/ALT peaked on HD2, likely ischemic hepatitis
   - Downtrending, no evidence of biliary obstruction or viral hepatitis
   - Plan: Monitor, supportive only

### 4. **Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP)**
   - Fever, increased WBC, purulent secretions, new infiltrate HD3
   - Empiric vanc/cefepime x72h, improved, cultures negative
   - Plan: Finish abx, monitor for recurrence

### 5. **Prediabetes**
   - HgbA1c 6.2%, transient hyperglycemia on pressors/steroids
   - Sliding scale insulin, now off
   - Plan: Endocrine f/u, continue lifestyle modifications

### 6. **Gynecological History**
   - Mirena IUD in situ, h/o miscarriage, prior OCP/implant use
   - No acute GYN issues during this admission

### 7. **DVT Prophylaxis**
   - Enoxaparin SQ, SCDs
   - No evidence of DVT/PE

### 8. **Nutrition**
   - NPO x48h, then enteral feeds via OG tube, advanced to PO on HD7

### 9. **Disposition**
   - Medically stable for transfer to stepdown on HD8
   - Plan for aggressive cardiac rehab, close outpatient follow-up

### ADMISSION HISTORY & PHYSICAL

**Chief Complaint:**  
Acute shortness of breath, orthopnea, chest pressure, and near-syncope at home.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. Demarcus Kuhlman is a 33-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent viral sinusitis who presented to the ED with progressive dyspnea, chest heaviness, and lightheadedness for 2 days. He had a mild viral syndrome ~10 days ago and was started on amoxicillin-clavulanate by PCP for presumed bacterial sinusitis. He developed worsening fatigue and orthopnea, prompting ED evaluation. In the ED, he was noted to be tachycardic, hypotensive (BP 82/48), and hypoxic (O2 sat 91% on RA), with JVD and bibasilar crackles. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Troponin elevated to 0.92 ng/mL, BNP 1680 pg/mL. Echo revealed severe global hypokinesis, LVEF ~15%. He was transferred to the CICU and started on dobutamine, then required emergent placement of a percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension (on triple therapy)  
- Recent viral sinusitis  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- None

**Family History:**

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN (Problem-based)

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to suspected viral myocarditis**
   - Impella CP placed for temporary circulatory support, now explanted
   - Gradual improvement in LVEF
   - Continue GDMT for HF (beta-blocker, ACEi, MRA as tolerated)
   - Monitor for arrhythmias, volume overload
   - Cardiac MRI pending

**2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
   - Initially required intubation, now extubated to HFNC
   - Diuresis, close monitoring of oxygenation
   - Daily CXR PRN

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, cardiorenal)**
   - Creatinine peaked at 1.9, now improved to 0.9
   - Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust diuretics

**4. Transaminitis (shock liver vs. congestion)**
   - Mild elevation AST/ALT, now trending down
   - Continue to trend LFTs

**5. Hypertension**
   - Hold home antihypertensives until stable
   - Restart as tolerated, goal SBP >100

**6. Recent sinusitis**
   - Completed course of amox-clav
   - No evidence of ongoing infection

**7. VTE Prophylaxis / Anticoagulation**
   - On heparin drip during Impella
   - Transition to SQ heparin post-device

**8. Nutrition**
   - Initially NPO, now on cardiac diet, advance as tolerated

**9. Disposition / Rehab**
   - Will require cardiac rehab evaluation
   - Discuss advanced HF therapies if no further improvement

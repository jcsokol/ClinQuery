CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest heaviness for 2 days prior to admission.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
79-year-old female with a complex PMHx notable for poorly controlled DM2, CKD1, HTN, metabolic syndrome, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and prior OB/GYN history as below, presenting with acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock requiring ICU admission and temporary mechanical circulatory support.

Pt was found at home by daughter, confused, tachypneic, with new peripheral edema and decreased urine output. EMS noted BP 78/45, HR 121, O2 sat 90% RA. In ED, patient became increasingly hypotensive and hypoxic, requiring norepinephrine and BiPAP. Echo revealed new severe global LV dysfunction (EF 20%), moderate MR, and mild RV dysfunction. Troponin elevated (peak 2.1 ng/mL). No acute STEMI. Cardiac cath: diffuse 2-vessel CAD, no culprit lesion, likely demand ischemia.

Due to ongoing shock and rising lactate, pt received a percutaneous Impella CP device on hospital day 1. Hemodynamics improved. Now day 6 of ICU course, weaning off vasopressors, Impella still in situ.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Hypertension
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent
- CKD stage 1, diabetic nephropathy
- Hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic syndrome X
- Anemia of chronic disease
- Osteoarthritis (knees)
- Colon polyp (removed 2022)
- History of multiple tubal pregnancies and 1st trimester miscarriage
- Viral sinusitis, recurrent pharyngitis, whiplash injury (remote)

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
- Laparoscopic salpingectomy (bilateral)
- Colonoscopy with polypectomy

ALLERGIES:
- NKDA

HOME MEDICATIONS:
- Amlodipine/HCTZ/Olmesartan 5/12.5/20 mg daily
- Metformin XR 500 mg daily
- Insulin NPH/Regular (Humulin 70/30) 16u AM, 10u PM
- Naproxen 220 mg prn
- Simvastatin 10 mg qHS
- Amox-clav 250/125 mg BID x10d (recent, for sinusitis)

SOCIAL HISTORY:
- Lives with daughter, retired teacher, independent ADLs prior to this admission
- Denies tobacco, EtOH, illicit drug use

FAMILY HISTORY:
- CAD (mother), DM2 (father), colon CA (brother)

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Unable to obtain full ROS due to intubation/somnolence. Per daughter, pt had increased dyspnea, orthopnea, 2-pillow PND, poor PO intake, mild cough, and confusion. No recent travel/infectious contacts.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
GEN: Elderly obese female, sedated, intubated, Impella in situ, central line R IJ, A-line L radial

ASSESSMENT & PLAN

1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Acute on Chronic HFrEF, s/p Impella CP (day 6)**
   - Acute decompensation likely precipitated by demand ischemia (severe hypertension, DM, CAD, infection).
   - Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support, currently still in place. MAP >65, weaning norepinephrine, lactate normalizing.
   - Continue daily echo, Impella flows, wean pressors as tolerated.
   - Plan for Impella wean/removal in next 24-48hr if sustained stability.
   - Daily labs, strict I/Os, monitor for hemolysis, limb ischemia, infection.
   - Cardiac surgery, HF, and interventional on board.

2. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin and Metformin**
   - Hyperglycemia on admission, now euglycemic with insulin sliding scale.
   - Hold metformin (AKI risk, lactic acidosis).
   - Monitor for hypoglycemia, adjust insulin as PO intake resumes.

3. **Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage 1), AKI on CKD**
   - Cr peaked at 2.8, now improving (1.6 today).
   - Likely pre-renal from shock, improved with volume/pressors.
   - Monitor UOP, electrolytes, avoid nephrotoxins.

4. **Anemia of Chronic Disease**
   - Hgb down-trending (17→13.5), likely dilutional, some hemolysis possible (Impella).
   - Daily CBC, monitor for transfusion needs.

5. **Hypertension/Metabolic Syndrome/Hyperlipidemia**
   - Continue home anti-HTN, hold statin for now (LFTs, rhabdo risk).
   - Resume as tolerated on transfer to floor.

6. **Volume Overload/Pulmonary Edema**
   - Improved with diuresis and Impella support.
   - Daily CXR, diurese as tolerated.

7. **Colon Polyp, Osteoarthritis, Remote OB/GYN History**
   - No acute issues.

8. **Infection Risk, Recent Sinusitis**
   - On empiric ceftriaxone/azithro for possible aspiration pneumonia (CXR, fever).
   - Monitor cultures, de-escalate as able.

9. **Nutrition, Delirium, DVT Prophylaxis**
   - NPO, on tube feeds.
   - SCDs, heparin sq.
   - Re-orient, minimize sedation.

10. **Disposition**
   - Remain in ICU, daily multidisciplinary rounds.
   - Anticipate transfer to stepdown after Impella removal and 48hr stability.

**Consult Notes**

*Cardiology (3/05):*  
Pt with new severe LV dysfunction, likely demand ischemia/possible myocarditis vs. ischemic. No STEMI. Impella CP for shock. Will monitor for recovery; consider advanced therapies if no improvement.

*Nephrology (3/06):*  
AKI on CKD, likely multifactorial (shock, pressors, contrast). Renal recovery expected. Avoid nephrotoxins, monitor volume, trend Cr/UOP.

*Endocrinology (3/07):*  
Hold metformin for now. Titrate insulin, avoid hypoglycemia. Resume metformin if renal function improves.

*Infectious Disease (3/06):*  
No clear source of infection; possible aspiration. Continue empiric abx, de-escalate if cultures negative.

*Physical Therapy (3/10):*  
Begin passive ROM, re-eval for early mobilization post-Impella removal.

**Discharge Planning**

- Anticipate ICU stay x2-3 more days for Impella wean/removal.
- If stable, transfer to stepdown, then rehab.
- Home with daughter; arrange home health, PT/OT.
- Needs close cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology f/u.
- Education re: HF, DM, med adherence, warning signs.

**Patient Education:**
- HF symptoms, fluid restriction, daily weights.
- DM monitoring, insulin administration.
- Medication reconciliation (statin, ACEi/ARB, etc).

**Advance Directives:**
- Daughter is POA. Full code. Discuss goals of care if no cardiac recovery.

**Summary:**
79F with DM2, CKD, HTN, CAD, acute decompensated HFrEF with cardiogenic shock, required percutaneous temporary LVAD (Impella CP), now improving. Anticipate slow recovery and need for multidisciplinary support.

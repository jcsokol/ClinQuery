### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
35-year-old female with past medical history notable for prediabetes, chronic anemia, prior miscarriage, and remote orthopedic injuries, presenting with 3 days of worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, and one episode of syncope at home. She called EMS due to persistent chest discomfort and palpitations. On arrival to the ED, she was tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic. She rapidly decompensated with evidence of cardiogenic shock requiring intubation and vasopressor support. Echo revealed severe global LV dysfunction (EF ~15%), no significant valvular abnormality, and no evidence of tamponade. No clear acute coronary syndrome identified. She was transferred to the MICU, and subsequently required placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2 for persistent shock despite maximal medical therapy. 

### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Anemia (chronic, likely iron deficiency)
- Prediabetes
- History of miscarriage (1st trimester)
- Normal pregnancy (remote)
- Ruptured patellar tendon, s/p repair (remote)
- Acute bronchitis (resolved)
- Wrist fracture/subluxation (remote)
- Streptococcal pharyngitis (remote)

### PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
- Patellar tendon repair
- Cesarean section (2018)

### GYNECOLOGIC HISTORY
- G3P1A1 (1 miscarriage, 1 full-term pregnancy)
- Last menstrual period: uncertain, on hormonal contraception

### SOCIAL HISTORY
- Non-smoker
- No alcohol, illicit drugs
- Lives with partner and child

### FAMILY HISTORY
- Mother: HTN, DM2
- Father: MI at age 58

### ALLERGIES
- NKDA

### HOME MEDICATIONS
- Chlorpheniramine maleate 2 mg/mL oral solution PRN
- Epinephrine 0.3 mL autoinjector (for allergies, never used)
- Ibuprofen 200 mg PO PRN
- Acetaminophen/hydrocodone 325/7.5 mg PO PRN
- Various contraceptive agents (see med list)
- Penicillin V potassium 500 mg PO (recent, for strep throat)

## HOSPITAL COURSE (Days 1-5)

**Day 1:**  
Admitted to MICU for acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock. Required norepinephrine and dobutamine. Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Initial labs notable for lactic acidosis, elevated troponin (non-dynamic), mild transaminitis, and AKI (Cr 1.4). Started on broad-spectrum antibiotics pending cultures (later negative).

**Day 2:**  
Worsening shock despite vasopressors/inotropes. Impella CP placed via right femoral artery for mechanical circulatory support. Rapid improvement in MAP and end-organ perfusion. Lactate decreased. Started on heparin drip for device.

**Day 3:**  
Hemodynamics stabilized. Extubated to high-flow nasal cannula. Weaned off norepinephrine. Impella flows satisfactory. Renal function improved. Hb trended down (nadir 8.3), transfused 1U PRBC. Serial Echos: persistent severe LV dysfunction, RV function preserved.

**Day 4:**  
Continued improvement. Mobilized to chair. Low-grade fever (38.2Â°C), blood and urine cx negative. Device site clean. Hb stable, mild thrombocytopenia (likely heparin effect). LFTs normalizing.

**Day 5:**  
Impella wean trial successful. Device removed at bedside. No access site bleeding/hematoma. Patient transitioned to low dose oral diuretic, beta-blocker initiated. Plans for cardiac MRI and outpatient advanced heart failure follow-up.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock, Severe LV Dysfunction (EF 15%)
- Impella CP placed, now removed after successful wean.
- Guideline-directed medical therapy initiated (beta-blocker, ACEi to be added).
- Plan: Cardiac MRI, advanced HF clinic, consider genetic testing, family screening.

### 2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
- Intubated, now extubated. Weaning O2, currently on room air.
- Monitor for pulmonary edema.

### 3. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)
- Likely pre-renal from low perfusion, now improved.
- Monitor UOP, trend creatinine.

### 4. Anemia
- Baseline chronic anemia, worsened with acute illness.
- Transfused 1U PRBC, now stable.
- Continue iron supplementation, GI work-up outpatient.

### 5. Thrombocytopenia
- Mild, likely secondary to heparin (not HIT).
- Monitor CBC, no bleeding.

### 6. Prediabetes
- Glucose controlled during admission.
- Continue lifestyle modifications.

### 7. Contraceptive Management
- Continue home regimen, avoid estrogen-containing agents if LV function remains low.

### 8. Secondary Prevention
- Cardiac rehab, lifestyle counseling, family education.
- Outpatient f/u in advanced HF clinic, consider ICD if EF persists <35%.

### 9. Social/Disposition
- Discharge planning with PT/OT.
- Home support adequate.

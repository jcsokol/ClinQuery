# Hospital Course (Summary):

**Day 0-1:**  
On arrival, Wenona was hypotensive and hypoxic. CXR: mild pulmonary edema. BNP 1650, troponin I 0.09 → 0.13. Echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, LV dilated, RV mildly reduced function. Cardiology consulted: concern for new-onset non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (viral myocarditis vs. idiopathic). Started on IV furosemide, dobutamine, and low-dose norepinephrine.  

**Day 2:**  
Despite escalating inotropes and diuresis, progressive hypoperfusion (lactate 4.1), worsening renal function, and persistent hypotension. CT surgery consulted for mechanical circulatory support.  

**Day 3:**  
Placed on percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) at bedside. Hemodynamics stabilized over next 24h (MAPs 65-75, improved urine output).  

**Day 4-7:**  
Slow improvement, weaned off vasopressors. Developed transient transaminitis (ALT/AST peaked ~180/210). No arrhythmias.  

**Day 8:**  
Impella weaned and removed after TTE showed LVEF improved to 30%.  

**Day 9-12:**  
Continued diuresis, transitioned to oral HF regimen (metoprolol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone). Transferred to stepdown, ambulating with PT.

# Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (New Onset Severe Systolic HF, likely viral myocarditis):**  
- Impella CP placed for refractory shock  
- IV dobutamine, norepinephrine → off by day 5  
- Serial TTEs  
- Cardiac enzymes trended  
- HF guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) initiated  
- Plan: Close f/u with HF and cardiology, consider endomyocardial biopsy if relapse

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, cardiorenal):**  
- Monitored daily chem7, urine output  
- Improved with hemodynamic support  
- Plan: Monitor, avoid nephrotoxins

**3. Transaminitis (shock liver):**  
- ALT/AST peaked at 180/210, normalized by day 8  
- No biliary obstruction, negative hepatitis panel  
- Plan: Monitor LFTs

**4. Obesity (BMI 30+):**  
- Counsel on diet, exercise  
- PT/OT for safe mobilization

**5. Viral URI/sinusitis hx:**  
- No evidence of bacterial superinfection  
- Supportive care only

**6. Osteoarthritis—knee:**  
- Naproxen prn pain, avoid NSAIDs if renal function worsens  
- PT assessment

**7. DVT prophylaxis:**  
- SCDs, transitioned to heparin SQ

**8. Stress ulcer prophylaxis:**  
- Pantoprazole IV

**9. Disposition:**  
- Plan for cardiac rehab, close outpatient f/u

## ICU Course Summary

**Hospital Day 1:**  
Admitted for acute decompensated heart failure, presumed viral myocarditis given recent viral prodrome and negative ischemic workup. On arrival, O2 sat 89% RA, BP 98/62, HR 112, RR 22, T 37.2°C. Bibasilar crackles, JVD, 2+ pitting edema. CXR: Pulmonary edema. Echo: EF 15%, global hypokinesis, no significant valvular dz. Troponin mildly elevated (0.18 → 0.22 ng/mL). BNP 2390 pg/mL.  
Started on BiPAP, IV furosemide, and dobutamine.  

**Hospital Day 2:**  
Progressive hypotension, MAP <60 despite pressors. Worsening lactic acidosis; urine output < 0.3 mL/kg/hr. Cardiogenic shock. Multidisciplinary discussion—temporary percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) placed bedside by interventional cardiology for hemodynamic stabilization.

**Hospital Day 3-4:**  
Hemodynamics improved on LV support. Weaned off pressors by day 4. Monitored for arrhythmias, no sustained VT/VF. Renal function stabilized, UOP improved. Developed mild transaminitis (AST/ALT peaked at 92/108). Infectious w/u negative for bacterial source.  

**Hospital Day 5-6:**  
LVAD weaned and explanted on day 6 after echo demonstrated recovery of LV function (EF improved to 38%). Transitioned to goal-directed medical therapy for heart failure. Mobilized out of bed. No further arrhythmias, off oxygen by day 6.

**Hospital Day 7:**  
Transferred out of ICU to stepdown. Plan for aggressive HF management, close outpatient f/u.

## Problem List & Assessment/Plan

**1. Cardiogenic Shock due to Acute Severe Systolic HF (likely viral myocarditis):**  
- Temporary LVAD (Impella) placed day 2 for refractory shock, explanted day 6 after LV recovery.  
- Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) initiated: low-dose carvedilol, lisinopril, spironolactone.  
- Strict I/Os, daily wt, low Na diet, fluid restriction.  
- Cardiac MRI pending outpatient for confirmation of myocarditis.  
- Education: s/sx of HF, strict follow-up with HF clinic.

**2. Hypertension:**  
- Previously on HCTZ, now switched to lisinopril for dual HF/HTN benefit.  
- Continue to monitor BP, titrate as tolerated.

**3. Obesity (BMI 30):**  
- Dietician consult, low Na/low fat diet.  
- Encourage mobilization, PT/OT involvement.  
- Outpatient weight loss program referral.

**4. Viral Sinusitis/Pharyngitis:**  
- Completed abx.  
- No ongoing symptoms, no evidence of superimposed bacterial infection.

**5. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved):**  
- Likely pre-renal from low output; improved with hemodynamic stabilization.  
- Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins.

**6. Transaminitis (mild, resolved):**  
- Suspected ischemic hepatitis during shock.  
- Downtrending, will recheck LFTs outpatient.

**7. DVT Prophylaxis:**  
- SCDs, SQ heparin while in ICU.

**8. Psychosocial:**  
- Supportive counseling, SW involved for discharge planning.

**INPATIENT PROGRESS NOTE**  
**Patient:** Gleason, Queenie  
**MRN:** 002394875  
**DOB:** 08/24/1939  
**Sex:** Female  
**Date of Service:** 06/19/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. L. Shapiro  
**Admitting Diagnosis:** Cardiogenic shock, s/p STEMI  
**Service:** ICU

### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Queenie Gleason is an 84-year-old female with a complex past medical history notable for prior ischemic stroke (2018), recurrent acute bronchitis, previous antepartum eclampsia (remote, 1960s), and a prior miscarriage, who presented to the ED 6 days ago with acute onset substernal chest pain, severe SOB, and confusion. She was found to be hypotensive (SBP 72 mmHg), tachycardic, and hypoxic. Initial EKG showed ST elevations in II, III, aVF. Troponin peaked at 18.9 ng/mL. She was emergently taken for cardiac cath, revealing 100% RCA occlusion, underwent PCI with DES placement, but developed refractory cardiogenic shock. She was intubated and placed on vasopressors. Due to persistent hypotension and rising lactate, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed at bedside.

She has since remained in the ICU, with fluctuating mental status and ongoing management of shock, AKI, and secondary complications. She is currently on low-dose norepinephrine, Impella support, and mechanical ventilation.

## ICU HOSPITAL COURSE  
**Day 0 (Admission):**  
- Presents with acute inferior STEMI, rapidly decompensates into cardiogenic shock  
- Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure  
- Emergent cardiac cath: RCA 100% occlusion → PCI with DES  
- Persistent hypotension despite pressors → Impella CP placed via femoral approach  
- Started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia  
- Initial labs: AKI, transaminitis, metabolic acidosis  

**Day 1-2:**  
- Remains intubated, Impella support ongoing  
- Norepinephrine titrated to MAP >65  
- Lactate trending down, urine output improving  
- Cardiology: possible wean of Impella if hemodynamics stable  
- Neuro: mild residual confusion, negative for acute bleed on CT  
- ID: CXR with RLL infiltrate, started ceftriaxone/azithro  
- Renal: Oliguric, creatinine uptrending  

**Day 3-4:**  
- Impella weaning trial attempted, but MAP drops to 54, lactate rises  
- Remains on Impella  
- Developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with RVR; started on amiodarone drip  
- Platelets downtrending, possible HIT considered, heparin switched to argatroban  
- Extubated briefly on day 4, but reintubated for worsening work of breathing  
- Family meeting held; daughter bedside  

**Day 5-6:**  
- Gradual improvement in hemodynamics, able to wean norepi  
- Impella flow decreased, tolerated  
- Creatinine improving, urine output >0.5 cc/kg/hr  
- Still febrile; blood cultures negative thus far  
- PT/OT consult placed

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, s/p STEMI, Impella CP**  
   - Ongoing support with Impella, weaning as tolerated.  
   - Vasopressors titrated to goal MAP >65.  
   - Serial lactates, echo monitoring.  
   - Daily ECG for arrhythmia monitoring.  
   - Plan: Continue gradual wean, reassess explant readiness.

**2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, s/p Intubation**  
   - Re-intubated (day 4) for fatigue.  
   - Vent weaning as tolerated.  
   - Daily CXR, SATS >92%.  
   - SBT daily.

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO stage 2)**  
   - Likely multifactorial (shock, nephrotoxins).  
   - IVF as tolerated, monitor UOP.  
   - Avoid nephrotoxics, daily BMP.

**4. New-onset Atrial Fibrillation**  
   - Amiodarone drip, transition to PO as able.  
   - Rate and rhythm monitoring.

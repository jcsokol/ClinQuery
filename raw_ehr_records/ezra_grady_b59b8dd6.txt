### **HOSPITAL COURSE - ADMISSION TO ICU**

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest tightness.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. Ezra Grady is a 54-year-old male with a history of osteoarthritis (right knee), chronic sinusitis, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and fatigue. He reported paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and 3-pillow orthopnea. No recent viral illness. He was initially managed in the ED for acute decompensated heart failure (HF) and was transferred to the MICU after developing hypotension and evidence of cardiogenic shock. He required vasopressor support (norepinephrine, then dobutamine) and was eventually started on a temporary left-sided percutaneous ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for refractory shock and hypoperfusion.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Chronic sinusitis  
- Osteoarthritis, right knee  
- Hyperlipidemia  
- Hypertension (newly diagnosed on this admission)  
- No prior history of CAD, but strong family history of premature MI  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Right knee arthroscopy (2018)  
- Tonsillectomy (childhood)  

**Medications on Admission:**  
- Naproxen sodium 220 mg PO PRN  
- Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly (home)  
- No home beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors  

**Social History:**  
- Former smoker, quit 2012, 10 pack-years  
- Occasional alcohol, no illicit drugs  
- Lives with spouse, works as a surveyor  

**Family History:**

**Review of Systems:**  
All other systems negative except as stated above.

### **IMAGING**

- **CXR (3/14):** Pulmonary vascular congestion, mild cardiomegaly, small right pleural effusion.
- **ECHO (3/14):** LVEF 18%, global hypokinesis, no significant valvular disease.
- **Repeat ECHO after Impella (3/15):** LVEF 22%, LV unloading, Impella seen in LV cavity.

---

### **HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY**

- Admitted to ICU on 3/14 for acute decompensated HF and cardiogenic shock.
- Required norepinephrine and dobutamine, max doses.
- Impella CP placed 3/15 for refractory shock.
- Gradual diuresis initiated (IV furosemide), net negative 2.5L by ICU day 3.
- Weaned off vasoactives by 3/17.
- Impella removed 3/18 after hemodynamic improvement.
- Monitored for access site bleeding (none noted).
- Started on low dose metoprolol and lisinopril as tolerated by BP.
- No significant arrhythmias during stay; brief episode of NSVT, self-limited.
- Transferred to telemetry 3/19.

### **PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to new onset HFrEF**
- Impella CP placed for LV support, removed after stabilization
- Diuresis with IV furosemide, now euvolemic
- Started GDMT (metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily)
- Monitoring for arrhythmias (telemetry)
- Cardiology/Heart Failure service following, plan for cardiac MRI as outpatient

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), multifactorial (pre-renal, low output)**
- Improved with volume status optimization
- Renal function trending back to baseline
- Avoid nephrotoxins
- Monitor I/Os, daily BMP

**3. Hyperlipidemia**
- Restarted atorvastatin 20 mg nightly
- Dietician consult for low sodium/low cholesterol diet

**4. Chronic Sinusitis**
- No acute sinus infection during this admission, continue home nasal steroids

**5. Osteoarthritis, right knee**
- Continue naproxen PRN, avoid NSAIDs if renal function worsens

**6. Other**
- DVT prophylaxis: SCDs, subcutaneous heparin
- Physical therapy consult for general deconditioning
- Social work for discharge planning, home support

---

### **DISPOSITION/PLAN**

- Transfer to telemetry for continued optimization
- Cardiac rehab referral
- Outpatient follow-up in HF clinic, 1 week post-discharge
- Strict low sodium diet, daily weights, medication education

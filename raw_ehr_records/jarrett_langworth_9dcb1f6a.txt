Shortness of breath, chest tightness, profound fatigue.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Jarrett Langworth is an 84-year-old male with a history of hypertension, prediabetes, chronic anemia, osteoarthritis, and recent viral pharyngitis who presented from home with 3 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest discomfort. He also endorsed cough and subjective fevers. On arrival, he was hypotensive (BP 82/47), tachycardic, and hypoxic on room air. Exam notable for elevated JVP, bilateral rales, and cool extremities. He was transferred to the ICU for management of cardiogenic shock.  
Initial workup revealed acute on chronic anemia, elevated BNP, and a new troponin rise. Echo demonstrated severely reduced LVEF (15%), global hypokinesis, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Despite inotropes/vasopressors, he remained in shock and required placement of a temporary left-sided heart pump (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support on hospital day 2.

### ICU COURSE (Days 1â€“5)

#### Day 1 (04/07/2024):  
Admitted in profound hypotension, hypoxia, and acute decompensated HF. Started on norepinephrine and dobutamine. O2 via HFNC. Labs notable for Hgb 11.6, Cr 1.2, BNP 2880, troponin I 0.44.  

#### Day 2:  
Progressive shock despite escalating inotropes. Lactate 5.2. Impella CP placed via right femoral artery. Hemodynamics improved over next 12 hours.  

#### Day 3:  
Stable on Impella, down-titrating pressors. Extubated to HFNC. Diuresis begun (IV furosemide).  

#### Day 4:  
Weaning off Impella support, echo shows improved LVEF (now 28%). Still mild pulmonary edema. Creatinine peaked at 1.6, trending down.  

#### Day 5:  
Impella removed. Transferred out of ICU to step-down for ongoing monitoring and rehab.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (acute on chronic HF, likely viral myocarditis)**
   - Impella CP placed for temporary support, now removed after hemodynamic recovery
   - Continue low-dose dobutamine x24h, then wean as tolerated
   - Restart home anti-HTN agents as BP allows; monitor renal function
   - Strict I/Os, daily weights, diuresis to euvolemia
   - Cardiology f/u; consider cardiac MRI outpatient for myocarditis

**2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
   - IV loop diuretics, titrate to net negative fluid balance
   - Salt/fluid restriction, daily CXR, labs
   - Continue monitoring for arrhythmias

**3. Chronic Anemia**
   - Multifactorial (chronic disease, CKD, age)
   - Transfused 1U PRBCs on 04/08 for Hgb <10
   - Iron studies pending; folate/B12 repleted

**4. AKI on CKD**
   - Likely pre-renal from hypoperfusion/shock
   - Now improving with volume/renal perfusion restoration
   - Monitor daily labs, avoid nephrotoxins

**5. Viral Pharyngitis/Bronchitis (recent)**
   - Cough and sore throat resolved, no new infiltrates
   - No abx started; viral panel positive for rhinovirus

**6. Osteoarthritis (knees)**
   - Continue acetaminophen prn, ice/heat as needed
   - Avoid NSAIDs if possible due to AKI/HF

**7. Hypertension/Prediabetes**
   - Hold anti-HTN during shock, now resuming
   - Monitor for hypo/hyperglycemia, A1c 6.2% (no DM meds needed)

**8. Disposition/Social**
   - Lives alone, ambulatory baseline
   - PT/OT assessment pending, likely needs rehab prior to discharge

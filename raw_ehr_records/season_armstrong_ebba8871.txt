**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, chest pressure, and orthopnea x 2 weeks.  

---

**HPI:**  
Season Armstrong is a 39-year-old female with a history of chronic hypertension, preeclampsia (remote), multiple pregnancies, and a recent viral illness who presented with acute dyspnea, lower extremity swelling, and chest heaviness. She was initially admitted to the floor for management of presumed hypertensive heart failure exacerbation. During her hospital course, she developed worsening hypoxemia and hypotension refractory to diuresis and vasodilators, with evidence of low cardiac output syndrome. She was transferred to the ICU and required temporary mechanical circulatory support with a left-sided Impella CP pump for acute cardiogenic shock.

**IMAGING:**  
- **CXR 5/24:** Pulmonary edema, mild cardiomegaly, small right pleural effusion.  
- **Echo 5/24:** LVEF 18%, global hypokinesis, mild MR, dilated LV, RV normal.  
- **Repeat Echo 5/28:** LVEF improved to 33% on Impella support.  
- **Abd US 5/25:** Mild hepatic congestion, no biliary ductal dilation.

**PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

1. **Cardiogenic Shock (new, likely viral myocarditis vs. peripartum cardiomyopathy)**
   - Required Impella CP placement for hemodynamic support (day 2 ICU)
   - Weaning vasopressors (off NE, on low-dose milrinone)
   - Daily echo to monitor recovery
   - Plan: Continue Impella, goal to explant when LVEF >35% and stable off pressors x 24hr
   - ID consult: Viral myocarditis panel sent

2. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
   - Diuresis with IV furosemide, fluid balance monitored closely
   - Daily weights, strict I/O
   - Na-restricted, fluid-restricted diet
   - Home antihypertensives held, restarting low-dose ACEi as tolerated

3. **Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal)**
   - Likely secondary to low cardiac output, Cr peaked at 1.56, now improving
   - Monitored electrolytes, K+ repleted as needed
   - Avoid nephrotoxins

4. **Mild Transaminitis**
   - Likely congestive hepatopathy; trending down as hemodynamics improve
   - Monitor LFTs every other day

5. **Respiratory Failure**
   - Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, now on pressure support trials
   - CXR improving, goal to extubate in next 24-48h

6. **Hypertension**
   - Previously well-controlled; off home regimen due to hypotension
   - Will restart as tolerated after Impella wean

7. **Gynecologic Hx (OCP/IUD/Nuvaring)**
   - Not currently pregnant; contraception discussed with OB
   - Mirena left in place; OCP/NR held in ICU

8. **DVT Prophylaxis**
   - SCDs in place; heparin SQ BID

9. **Pain/Comfort**
   - On fentanyl drip, weaning as tolerated
   - PRN acetaminophen

10. **Nutrition**
    - NPO, on tube feeds; plan for PO diet after extubation

11. **Disposition**
    - Remain in ICU until Impella explant and off pressors
    - Anticipate step-down to telemetry in 2-3 days if stable

---

**TO DO / SIGN-OUT:**
- Monitor hemodynamics, continue daily labs and echo
- Trend LFTs, renal function, cardiac markers
- Wean sedation and ventilatory support
- Consider Impella explant if stable by 5/31
- Update family daily

---

**Attestation:**  
I have reviewed the above note, discussed with the ICU team, and agree with the assessment and plan.

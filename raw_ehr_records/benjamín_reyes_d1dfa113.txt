### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Progressive dyspnea, confusion, fever.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Benjamín Reyes is a 111-year-old man (DOB: 10/17/1912) with a past medical history of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (including recent pneumonia and acute bronchitis), cystitis, and multiple recent viral upper respiratory tract infections, who presented from his nursing facility with 3 days of fever, productive cough, progressive dyspnea, and acute-on-chronic confusion. Per caregivers, baseline cognitive function is severely impaired (MMSE 3/30), non-ambulatory, minimal verbal output.

On arrival to ED: Found to be hypoxic (O2 sat 83% RA), tachypneic (RR 31), febrile (T 38.2°C oral), BP 98/60, HR 112. CXR: right lower lobe consolidation. Labs notable for leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, mild transaminitis. Shortly after admission to MICU, the patient developed hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressors and intubation. Echocardiogram: LVEF 24%, global hypokinesis. Given persistent cardiogenic shock, decision made to place Impella CP device for temporary left ventricular support on hospital day 2.

---

### HOSPITAL COURSE (MICU DAYS 1–5)
- **Day 1:** Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Started broad-spectrum abx (cefepime, azithro, vanc). Vasopressors titrated for MAP >65.
- **Day 2:** Cardiac index 1.4, rising lactate (4.1), worsening renal function. Impella CP placed via right femoral access. Nitroglycerin and dobutamine added. Some improvement in perfusion.
- **Day 3:** Weaned off norepi, still on Impella support. WBC downtrending, cultures pending. Minimal improvement in mental status, likely multifactorial (sepsis, dementia, metabolic).
- **Day 4:** Developed hematuria, foley replaced. Nitrofurantoin continued for cystitis. LFTs stable. CXR with improving consolidation.
- **Day 5:** Impella flows reduced, preparing for device wean. Transitioned to nasal cannula. Renal function improved. Persistent delirium.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**111M with severe dementia, pneumonia, shock, now s/p temporary LV support (Impella CP)**

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock (s/p Impella CP)
- Likely multifactorial (sepsis, underlying cardiomyopathy)
- Impella flows stable, MAP maintained
- Plan: Wean Impella as tolerated, continue cardiac monitoring, daily TTE, trend lactate. Consider explant if stable off pressors >24h.

### 2. Pneumonia (RLL, likely bacterial)
- Receiving cefepime and azithro, de-escalate based on cultures
- Daily CXR, continue pulmonary toilet, wean sedation as tolerated

### 3. Dementia (familial early-onset Alzheimer's)
- Baseline MMSE 3/30, severe impairment, nonverbal
- Delirium likely multifactorial (infection, metabolic, ICU)
- Plan: Avoid deliriogenic meds, frequent reorientation, family update

### 4. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal vs cardiorenal)
- Improved with hemodynamic support, daily labs
- Foley in place for monitoring
- Hold nephrotoxins

### 5. Cystitis
- Nitrofurantoin, phenazopyridine continued
- Urine cx pending, will adjust abx as needed

### 6. Acute Respiratory Failure (post-extubation)
- Weaning to nasal cannula, monitor ABG, incentive spirometry

### 7. Nutrition
- NPO, tube feeds initiated on day 2, goal calories met

### 8. DVT Prophylaxis
- SCDs, heparin 5000U SQ BID

### 9. Skin Integrity

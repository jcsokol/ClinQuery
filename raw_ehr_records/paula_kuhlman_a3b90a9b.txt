### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Paula Kuhlman is a 31-year-old female with a history of hypertension, multiple recent upper respiratory infections, and a reported normal pregnancy, who presented with acute onset dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest tightness following a week of progressive viral symptoms. On admission, she was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure (HF) with evidence of cardiogenic shock (SBP 82/54, HR 120, lactate 4.2 mmol/L, cold extremities, altered mentation). Despite initial diuresis and vasopressor support, she required emergent placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support. She was transferred to the ICU for ongoing management.

## HOSPITAL COURSE

**Day 1 (ED/Admission):**  
- Presented with acute respiratory distress, hypoxemia (SpO2 91% RA), hypotension.
- Initial labs: troponin mildly elevated, BNP 1,120 pg/mL, CXR: pulmonary edema, enlarged cardiac silhouette.
- Started on IV furosemide, nitroglycerin, then norepinephrine for hypotension.
- Echo: severe global LV dysfunction, EF ~18%, mild RV dysfunction.
- Decision made to proceed with temporary LVAD (Impella) for refractory cardiogenic shock.

**Day 2–3 (MICU):**  
- Impella in place, hemodynamics stabilized on minimal vasopressors.
- Developed transient AKI (Cr peaked at 1.7), improved with gentle diuresis and reduction in pressors.
- Monitored for arrhythmias (short runs NSVT, no sustained VT/VF).
- Infectious workup: negative blood/urine cultures, negative COVID/Flu/RSV, negative strep throat, but positive rhinovirus/enterovirus on NP swab.
- Cardiology and MFM consulted due to pregnancy and advanced heart failure.
- OB US: live IUP, 13 weeks, normal fetal HR.

**Day 4–6:**  
- Weaned off vasopressors, Impella flows reduced, echo shows improving LV function (EF up to 34%).
- WBC rose to 12.2, concern for secondary infection (possibly VAP), started empiric cefepime/azithro.
- Serial troponins trended down, CK/CK-MB normalizing.
- Liver enzymes transiently up (AST 82, ALT 99) with improved trend.
- Renal function returned to baseline.

**Day 7–9:**  
- Impella weaned and explanted on day 8 after successful 24-hr trial off device.
- Transferred to stepdown for continued monitoring.
- Infectious symptoms resolved, antibiotics discontinued after 5 days.
- Repeat echo: EF 38%, mild MR, no LV thrombus.
- Discharged home with LifeVest, close cardiology and high-risk OB follow-up.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated HF**
- **Assessment:** Severe LV dysfunction, likely viral myocarditis vs. peripartum cardiomyopathy.
- **Plan:**
  - Temporary LVAD (Impella) placed, now explanted.
  - Diuresis (IV furosemide), afterload reduction (hydralazine/nitrate), beta-blocker re-initiation as tolerated.
  - Daily echo, hemodynamic monitoring.
  - Cardiology f/u, LifeVest on discharge.

### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury (prerenal)**
- **Assessment:** Likely secondary to hypoperfusion, improved with volume/CO optimization.
- **Plan:**
  - Strict I/Os, daily chem7.
  - Avoid nephrotoxins.
  - Renal function normalized prior to transfer.

### 3. **Acute Respiratory Failure / Pulmonary Edema**
- **Assessment:** Due to acute HF, required non-invasive ventilation for 48 hrs.
- **Plan:**
  - Diuresis, oxygen support.
  - Serial CXR, ABG monitoring.
  - Weaned to RA prior to stepdown.

### 4. **Pregnancy, 13 weeks (high risk)**
- **Assessment:** Stable IUP, no evidence of fetal distress.
- **Plan:**
  - MFM co-management, limited imaging.
  - Avoid teratogenic meds (ACEi/ARB).
  - Serial fetal monitoring.

### 5. **Possible Secondary Infection (VAP)**
- **Assessment:** Fever, leukocytosis, new infiltrate on CXR.
- **Plan:**
  - Empiric cefepime/azithromycin, d/c’d after 5 days.
  - Infectious Disease consult.

### 6. **Hypertension**
- **Assessment:** Difficult to control, exacerbated by acute HF, now improved.
- **Plan:**
  - Resume outpatient regimen (HCTZ, atenolol/chlorthalidone) as tolerated.
  - Monitor BP q4h.

### 7. **History of Sinusitis, Bronchitis, Pharyngitis**
- **Assessment:** Not active, recent viral URI (rhinovirus).
- **Plan:**
  - Supportive care, monitor for secondary bacterial infection.

### 8. **Medication Reconciliation**
- **Assessment:** Multiple OCPs, HCTZ, vitamin B12.
- **Plan:**
  - Hold estrogen-containing OCPs, continue prenatal vitamins.
  - Medroxyprogesterone d/c’d.

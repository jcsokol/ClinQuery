**EPIC EHR - Inpatient Progress Note**

**Patient:** Medhurst, Graham  
**MRN:** 10203948  
**DOB:** 06/30/1936  
**Sex:** M  
**Admit Date:** 05/11/2024  
**Service:** MICU  
**Attending:** Dr. Reilly  
**Consults:** Cardiology, Endocrinology, Orthopedics, Infectious Disease  

---

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and new left lower extremity swelling.

---

**HPI:**  
Graham Medhurst is an 87-year-old male with a history of prediabetes, osteoporosis with multiple pathological fractures (left ankle, right forearm), chronic anemia, and recent viral pharyngitis. He presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening dyspnea, bilateral leg swelling (L > R), and increasing fatigue. He denied chest pain but noted palpitations and was found to be hypotensive on arrival (BP 82/58 mmHg). He was admitted to the ICU for management of acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Notably, his hospital course was complicated by progressive hemodynamic instability requiring the placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on HD#2. He is currently intubated and sedated, on low-dose norepinephrine.

## Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
   - HFrEF (LVEF 22%) likely secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute on chronic.
   - Required Impella CP placement on HD#2 for persistent hypotension and rising lactate despite inotropes.
   - On norepinephrine (0.04 mcg/kg/min), Impella flows ~3.2 L/min.
   - Daily echo for device positioning.
   - Wean vasoactives as tolerated, consider trial off Impella if hemodynamics improve.
   - Strict I/O, daily weights, diuresis as tolerated (IV furosemide).
   - Monitor for complications: hemolysis, limb ischemia, arrhythmias.
   - Cardiology following.

### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury (Stage 2)**
   - Likely multifactorial: low cardiac output, nephrotoxic insults (contrast, hypotension).
   - Trending creatinine, daily BMPs.
   - Renal dosing of all medications.
   - Hold nephrotoxins, monitor urine output.
   - Nephrology aware.

### 3. **Chronic Anemia**
   - Baseline Hgb ~11, now as low as 8.7.
   - Likely multifactorial: chronic disease, possible GI losses (occult blood negative).
   - Iron panel, retic count pending.
   - Transfuse for Hgb <7.5 or symptomatic.
   - GI consult if further drop.

### 4. **Osteoporosis / Pathologic Fractures**
   - Chronic, on alendronate.
   - LLE splint in place for old ankle fracture.
   - Minimize fall risk, PT/OT to evaluate when extubated.
   - Calcium/Vit D replete.

### 5. **Hyperglycemia / Prediabetes**
   - Recent A1c 6.2%.
   - Stress hyperglycemia noted (glucose up to 112).
   - Sliding scale insulin as needed.
   - Endocrinology to follow.

### 6. **Transaminitis**
   - Mild-moderate elevation in AST/ALT, likely ischemic hepatitis.
   - Trend LFTs, supportive care.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins.

### 7. **Pain Control**
   - Oxycodone/acetaminophen prn, but currently intubated.
   - IV fentanyl for sedation/pain.
   - Monitor for oversedation, constipation.

### 8. **Acute viral pharyngitis**
   - Resolved, no ongoing symptoms.

### 9. **Pressure Ulcer (Stage 1, sacrum)**
   - Wound care consult.
   - Turn q2h, barrier cream.

### 10. **Other**
   - DVT prophylaxis: Heparin SQ
   - Stress ulcer prophylaxis: Pantoprazole IV
   - Vaccinations: Up to date per family

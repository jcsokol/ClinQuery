### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, fatigue, chest pressure, and LE edema x 2 weeks. Brought in via EMS after acute decompensation at home.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Vanessa Reinger is a 51-year-old female with a history of T2DM, chronic hypertension, metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, prediabetes, and diabetic neuropathy, who presented with acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation. She had a recent viral URI one week prior, followed by increasing dyspnea, PND, and pedal edema. EMS found her hypoxic and tachycardic at home; she was admitted to the ICU for further management. Within 24 hours, she developed cardiogenic shock refractory to medical therapy, requiring urgent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

- **Day 1:** Admitted with acute decompensated heart failure; started on IV furosemide, BiPAP, dobutamine, and norepinephrine.
- **Day 2:** Cardiogenic shock worsened; echo: LVEF ~15%, global hypokinesis, no tamponade. Right heart cath: CI 1.7, PCWP 23, SVR 1800. Impella CP placed via femoral approach. Started on broad-spectrum abx for possible pneumonia.
- **Day 3-5:** Gradual improvement in end-organ perfusion, weaned off norepinephrine. Renal function transiently worsened, improved with diuresis. Diabetic control challenging, sliding scale insulin started. Developed mild transaminitis, likely ischemic hepatitis.
- **Day 6:** Impella weaned, removed after successful 24hr off support. Transferred to step-down unit. Mobilization started with PT/OT.
- **Day 7-9:** Continued diuresis, improved respiratory status. Blood glucose stabilized. Remained mildly anemic. Discharge planning initiated.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic shock, acute on chronic HFrEF**  
- Etiology: Likely viral myocarditis on background of diabetic/HTN heart disease  
- Impella CP placed, now removed after 4 days support  
- Continue aggressive diuresis, monitor for arrhythmias  
- Telemetry, daily weights, strict I/Os  
- Consider GDMT optimization after stabilization  
- F/u echo planned

**2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus / Hyperglycemia**  
- Poor control during critical illness, now improving  
- Sliding scale insulin, resume Metformin as renal function normalizes  
- Endocrine to follow

**3. Hypertension**  
- On multiple agents, held while on pressors  
- Gradual reinitiation as hemodynamics stabilize  
- Monitor for hypotension

**4. Anemia, multifactorial (chronic disease, dilutional, phlebotomy)**  
- Hgb trending down but stable, no transfusion needed  
- Iron studies pending, monitor CBC

**5. Acute kidney injury, resolved**  
- Pre-renal from hypoperfusion, improved with volume status correction  
- Monitor renal function closely

**6. Transaminitis (ischemic hepatitis)**  
- Trend LFTs, supportive care

**7. Pneumonia / bronchitis**  
- Treated empirically with ceftriaxone/azithro, improved  
- Repeat CXR planned

**8. Neuropathy, diabetic**  
- Continue gabapentin  
- PT/OT for mobilization

**9. Hypertriglyceridemia / Metabolic syndrome**  
- Resume statin/fibrate after acute phase  
- Dietary counseling

**10. Contraceptive management**  
- Multiple forms noted, review for VTE risk given immobility  
- Gyn consult requested

**11. Pain, chronic and acute (musculoskeletal)**  
- Mild, managed with acetaminophen  
- Avoid NSAIDs due to renal/LV dysfunction

**12. Discharge planning**  
- Anticipate SNF vs. home with VNA  
- Outpatient f/u: Cardiology, Endocrine, PT/OT

---

### ORDERS & CONSULTS

- Cardiology: daily
- Endocrine: glycemic management
- Infectious Disease: abx guidance
- PT/OT: mobility, safety eval
- Dietician: DM/CHF diet

---

**Problem-Based Assessment & Plan:**

1. **Cardiogenic Shock s/p Anterior STEMI, Impella CP (now explanted)**
   - Emergent PCI to LAD, Impella for LV support, now off device
   - Weaned off pressors, now on low-dose dobutamine
   - Monitor for arrhythmias, daily TTE
   - Continue DAPT, consider beta-blocker once stable

2. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, poorly controlled**
   - Hold metformin until renal function stable
   - Transition to basal-bolus insulin regimen
   - Endo consult; monitor for hypoglycemia, daily FS

3. **Acute Kidney Injury on CKD Stage 1**
   - Likely multifactorial (hypoperfusion, contrast)
   - Monitor daily BMP, strict I/Os, nephrology following
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal function

4. **Anemia of Chronic Disease**
   - Hgb trending down, likely multifactorial
   - Monitor CBC, no active bleed
   - Iron studies pending, GI following for history of polyps

5. **Metabolic Syndrome, Hypertriglyceridemia**
   - Statin held due to acute event, re-initiate when LFTs normalize
   - Low-fat, diabetic diet; monitor lipids

6. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
   - Not acute, continue outpatient follow-up

7. **History of Colonic Polyps**
   - No evidence of GI bleed or active polyp disease
   - GI to follow during admission

8. **Other**
   - DVT prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin SQ
   - Foley care, early mobilization
   - PT/OT consult for deconditioning

---

**To Do / Orders:**
- Daily CBC, BMP
- Serial troponins until negative
- TTE tomorrow
- Monitor UOP, strict I/Os
- Continue dobutamine, titrate as tolerated
- DAPT (ASA, ticagrelor), IV heparin
- VTE prophylaxis
- Cardiology, Nephrology, Endocrinology, GI consults

---

**Disposition:**  
- Cardiac ICU → step-down unit when stable  
- Plan for cardiac rehab, outpatient follow-up with cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology

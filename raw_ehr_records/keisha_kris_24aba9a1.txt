### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Keisha Kris is a 33-year-old female with a history of multiple pregnancies (including antepartum eclampsia and prior miscarriage), recently postpartum (G5P3), who presented to the ED with acute shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest pressure 6 days postpartum. She was tachypneic, hypotensive, and hypoxic at presentation. Initial evaluation suggested acute decompensated heart failure, likely peripartum cardiomyopathy, complicated by cardiogenic shock and multiorgan dysfunction.

She required emergent transfer to the ICU, intubation for respiratory distress, and placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for circulatory support on hospital day 1 due to refractory hypotension and rising lactate despite maximal medical therapy.

Her course was further complicated by acute kidney injury, transaminitis, and mild DIC. She required vasopressors, inotropes, and aggressive diuresis once stabilized. The Impella was weaned and explanted on hospital day 6 as cardiac function improved. She is currently extubated, off pressors, and working with PT/OT.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic shock, likely peripartum cardiomyopathy**
   - Admitted to ICU, required intubation, vasopressors, inotropes.
   - Emergent Impella CP placed for refractory shock.
   - Gradual improvement in cardiac function; Impella explanted on HD#6.
   - Now off vasopressors, weaning diuretics, optimizing heart failure regimen (metoprolol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone).
   - Plan: Cardiac rehab, continue GDMT, f/u TTE in 2 weeks.

### 2. **Acute kidney injury, multifactorial (pre-renal, cardiorenal)**
   - Initial Cr up to 2.3, now improved to 0.9.
   - Monitored UOP, avoided nephrotoxins, gentle diuresis, IVF as needed.
   - Plan: Monitor labs, nephrology to follow.

### 3. **Transaminitis/possible shock liver**
   - AST/ALT peaked at 242/198, now trending down.
   - No evidence of viral hepatitis or biliary obstruction.
   - Plan: Continue to monitor, expect further improvement.

### 4. **Peripartum state/postpartum care**
   - G5P3, delivered 8 days ago.
   - No heavy bleeding, uterus involuting, lochia normal.
   - OB-GYN consulted, Mirena to remain in place.
   - Plan: Lactation support, routine postpartum care.

### 5. **Mild DIC (resolved)**
   - Mild thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, no active bleeding.
   - Corrected with supportive care, now resolved.

### 6. **History of eclampsia**
   - No current HTN or seizures.
   - Plan: Monitor BP, magnesium not indicated.

### 7. **Infection prophylaxis**
   - No evidence of pneumonia, UTI, or line sepsis.
   - Completed 5d amox-clav for sinusitis prior to this admission.

### 8. **VTE prophylaxis**
   - On LMWH since HD#2.

### 9. **Other**
   - Laceration of foot (2022): healed, no current issues.
   - Social: Lives with partner and 3 children, planning for discharge needs.
   - Dispo: Anticipate transfer to stepdown in 24-48h.

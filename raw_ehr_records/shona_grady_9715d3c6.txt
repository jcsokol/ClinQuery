### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Ms. Shona Grady is a 24-year-old female with past medical history significant for chronic sinusitis, recurrent otitis media, acute bronchitis, streptococcal pharyngitis, and normal prior pregnancy, who presented to the ED with acute-onset shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and malaise. She rapidly decompensated on the floor with hypotension and hypoxia, requiring transfer to the MICU. Initial work-up revealed severe cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to acute viral myocarditis (Coxsackie B titers positive, troponin mildly elevated, echo with LVEF 12%). She required intubation, vasopressor support, and subsequently placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic stabilization.

## ICU ADMISSION NOTE

**Chief Complaint:**  
Acute shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion

**History of Present Illness:**  
24 y/o F with no cardiac history presented with 3 days of viral prodrome (myalgias, fever, sore throat) followed by abrupt onset SOB and chest pain. In ED: tachycardic, hypotensive, hypoxic, rapidly worsening mental status. Initial imaging: CXR with pulmonary edema, ECG: sinus tach, diffuse low-voltage QRS. Troponin mild elevation, echo: global hypokinesis, LVEF 12%. Moved to ICU for escalating pressor needs, intubated for hypoxic resp failure. Cardiology and CT surgery consulted. Decision made for Impella CP placement for mechanical circulatory support.

**Physical Exam (on admission):**  
- General: Ill-appearing, diaphoretic, confused  
- HEENT: Oropharynx clear, no tonsillar exudate  
- Lungs: Rales at bases bilaterally  
- CV: Tachycardic, S3, cool extremities, JVD  
- Abd: Soft, mild hepatomegaly  
- Neuro: Withdraws to pain, non-focal

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, likely viral myocarditis (Coxsackie B):**  
- Acute decompensated HF with severe LV dysfunction  
- Impella CP placed 4/17 for hemodynamic support  
- Weaned off vasopressors by 4/19  
- Serial TTE: LVEF improved to 38% by 4/20  
- Diuresis with IV furosemide, net -4.2L in 72h  
- Plan: Continue Impella wean, repeat TTE, consider explantation 4/21, monitor for arrhythmias

**2. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure:**  
- Intubated on 4/17, extubated 4/19  
- Improved O2 sat, CXR improving  
- Incentive spirometry, pulmonary toilet

**3. Acute kidney injury (pre-renal):**  
- Likely secondary to low-output state  
- Creatinine peaked at 1.5, improved with volume management  
- Monitor UOP, avoid nephrotoxins

**4. Transaminitis:**  
- Mild-moderate AST/ALT elevation, likely ischemic hepatitis  
- Down-trending as cardiac output improves

**5. Infection risk (immunosuppression, device):**  
- Blood cultures x2, urine culture negative  
- Empiric cefepime/vancomycin x48h, discontinued after negative cultures  
- Monitor temp, WBC

**6. Contraception:**  
- Yaz held during acute illness due to VTE risk  
- Will resume after discharge

**7. Other chronic issues:**  
- Sinusitis/otitis: No current symptoms  
- Sore throat: Resolved, likely viral  
- Sprained ankle: Remote, no sequelae  
- Psychosocial: Family at bedside, supportive

**Disposition:**  
- Continue close monitoring in ICU  
- If cardiac function stable, consider transfer to step-down unit after Impella explant  
- Anticipate prolonged cardiac rehab

Service: Pediatric ICU

---------------------------------------------------------------
**ADMISSION NOTE**

**Chief Complaint:**  
Acute respiratory distress, fever, and chest pain.

**HPI:**  
Cheree Abshire is a 17-year-old female with a hx of recurrent respiratory tract infections (acute/chronic sinusitis, otitis media, viral pharyngitis), and remote right wrist fracture/subluxation, who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening cough, fever to 39°C, pleuritic chest pain, and progressive dyspnea. She reported orthopnea and fatigue. No recent travel, sick contacts, or known COVID exposures. Initial evaluation in the ED revealed tachycardia, hypoxemia, and mild hypotension. She was admitted to the PICU for escalating respiratory distress and hemodynamic compromise. 

During the first 24h, she developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and evidence of cardiogenic shock. She required intubation and was started on vasopressors. TTE revealed severely depressed LV function (EF ~18%), globally hypokinetic, no pericardial effusion. She was started on milrinone, but remained hypotensive with poor end-organ perfusion, necessitating placement of a temporary left-sided heart pump (Impella CP) on hospital day 2 for hemodynamic support.

**PMH:**  
- Acute & chronic sinusitis  
- Otitis media  
- Acute viral pharyngitis  
- Acute bronchitis (multiple episodes)  
- Fracture/subluxation of right wrist (remote)

**PSH:** None

**Allergies:** NKDA

**Medications on Admission:**  
- Acetaminophen 325 mg PO  
- Acetaminophen 160 mg PO  
- Amoxicillin 250 mg PO  
- Penicillin V 250 mg PO  
- Ibuprofen 100 mg PO  

**Social History:**  
Lives with parents. No tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. Attends high school. No pets at home.

**Family History:**  
Mother with asthma. No known cardiac disease, sudden cardiac death, or autoimmune disease in the family.

**Review of Systems:**  
Fever, cough, chest pain, SOB, orthopnea, malaise. Otherwise negative.

**Physical Exam (on admission):**  
Gen: Ill-appearing, moderate respiratory distress  
HEENT: Moderate nasal congestion, pharyngeal erythema, no exudates  
Lungs: Tachypneic, diffuse crackles, mild wheezing  
CV: Tachycardic, S3 gallop, cool extremities, delayed cap refill  
Abd: Soft, mild hepatomegaly  
Neuro: Awake, oriented, no focal deficits  
Skin: No rash, mild mottling

**Vital Signs (on admission):**  
T: 38.8°C    HR: 132   BP: 89/52   RR: 32   SpO2: 91% (2L NC)   Wt: 51.4 kg   Ht: 148.7 cm   BMI: 23.2 (90th %ile)

- Started empiric ceftriaxone + azithromycin  
- Blood, sputum, viral PCR sent

Day 2:  
- Persistent shock, worsening lactate, rising creatinine  
- Multidisciplinary conference: concern for fulminant myocarditis (viral vs. post-infectious)  
- Impella CP (5.0) placed via femoral artery  
- Improved MAP, lactate trended down  
- Repeat TTE: Impella in place, LV unloading  
- Transaminitis noted, likely hypoperfusion

Day 3-5:  
- Gradual improvement in hemodynamics  
- Weaned off norepi (day 4), milrinone continued  
- Negative blood cultures, viral PCR positive for enterovirus  
- LFTs improved, creatinine normalized  
- Extubated on day 5  
- Impella wean protocol initiated

Day 6:  
- Impella removed, transitioned to low-dose milrinone  
- Mobilized to step-down unit  
- Echo: EF improved to 38%, mild global hypokinesis  
- Mild transaminitis persists

Day 7-8:  
- Stable on room air, off vasoactive meds  
- Ambulating, tolerating diet  
- Discharge planning, outpatient cardiology f/u arranged

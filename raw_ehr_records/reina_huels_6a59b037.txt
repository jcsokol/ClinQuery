### **HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**
71-year-old female with history of prediabetes, remote miscarriage, and recent viral upper respiratory illness presented to ED with 3 days of progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest tightness. On arrival, tachypneic, hypoxic, hypotensive (SBP 78 mmHg), and tachycardic (HR 123). CXR showed pulmonary edema. Troponin mildly elevated. Bedside echo: severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, no significant valvulopathy, no LV thrombus. No prior known cardiac history. Required transfer to cardiac ICU for management of acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to fulminant viral myocarditis.

Emergent placement of left-sided temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP) on hospital day 1 due to refractory shock. Subsequently stabilized with inotropes, diuresis, and supportive care. Complicated by AKI and transient hepatic congestion.

- **Day 2:** Rising creatinine, mild transaminitis. Improved BP, weaned off pressors by evening.
- **Day 3-4:** Gradual diuresis, extubated on day 4. Impella flows stable.
- **Day 5:** Impella wean trial started. LVEF improved to 28%. Renal and liver function improving.

## **ASSESSMENT & PLAN (PROBLEM-BASED)**

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Fulminant Myocarditis**
   - Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support
   - Weaning in progress, LVEF improving
   - Continue telemetry, daily echo assessment
   - If stable, plan device explant tomorrow  
   - Monitor for hemolysis, device complications

### 2. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
   - IV diuresis (Lasix)
   - Fluid status, daily weights
   - Restrict fluids/Na
   - Serial BNP, chemistry

### 3. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), resolving**
   - Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, diuretics
   - Renal panel qAM
   - Hold nephrotoxins, monitor urine output

### 4. **Transaminitis/Hepatic Congestion, improved**
   - Monitor LFTs
   - Expect further improvement with euvolemia

### 5. **Prediabetes**
   - Monitor glucose, no antihyperglycemics needed

### 6. **Risk of Infection**
   - Central/arterial/Impella line care
   - Daily blood cultures x2 (until off device)
   - VAP bundle

### 7. **Nutrition/Delirium/ICU Care**
   - Early enteral feeds
   - OOB to chair as tolerated
   - PT/OT, minimize sedation

### 8. **Disposition/Social**
   - Discuss goals of care with family
   - Anticipate transfer to step-down if stable post-Impella

---

## **MEDICATIONS (HOSPITAL DAY 5):**
- IV Lasix 40 mg q8h
- Aspirin 81 mg daily
- Heparin infusion (per Impella protocol)
- Multivitamin, pantoprazole, acetaminophen PRN
- No home meds resumed

## **Chief Complaint**
Shortness of breath, cough, fever, and recent syncopal episode at home.  

---

## **HPI**
John Daniel is a 17-year-old female with a PMH notable for viral sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and recent right wrist subluxation. Patient presented to the ED with a 3-day history of worsening cough, fatigue, and low-grade fever. On day of admission, she developed acute dyspnea, chest tightness, and had a syncopal episode. EMS found her tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic (O2 sat 87% RA). In the ED, she required non-rebreather oxygen and was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with evidence of cardiogenic shock (BP 78/42, HR 134, cool extremities, altered mentation). Echo showed severely depressed LV systolic function (EF 15%). She was transferred to the PICU and underwent urgent placement of a temporary left-sided ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic stabilization.

## **Hospital Course Summary**

**Day 1 (5/22/24):**  
Admitted to PICU in cardiogenic shock. Pressors (epi, milrinone) started. Intubated for respiratory distress. Emergent echo: severe global LV dysfunction (EF 15%), mild RV impairment, no pericardial effusion. Labs: lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury (Cr 1.8). Infectious workup sent. Temporary Impella CP inserted via femoral approach for LV support.

**Day 2-3:**  
Hemodynamics improved post-Impella. Vasopressors weaned. Renal function stabilized. Extubated on day 3. Serial echos: stable severe LV dysfunction. Infectious workup neg for bacterial/viral myocarditis. Cardiac MRI pending.

**Day 4-5:**  
Improvement in end-organ function. Mobilized to chair. Impella weaned and explanted on day 5. Transitioned to oral heart failure therapy (lisinopril, carvedilol). Ongoing cough, but no new fevers.

**Day 6-7:**  
Stable on oral meds. Off O2. Echo: persistent but improved LV function (EF 28%). Repeat labs: trending toward baseline. Discharge planning started.

## **Assessment and Plan**  
### 1. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure / Cardiogenic Shock**
- Likely viral myocarditis vs. idiopathic
- Required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for stabilization
- Now hemodynamically stable, off pressors, weaning support
- Continue HF meds (lisinopril, carvedilol)
- Daily weights, strict I/Os
- Cardiology f/u, cardiac MRI pending

### 2. **Acute Bronchitis / Viral Sinusitis**
- Recent URI, likely precipitated cardiac event
- Supportive care, continue cough/cold meds PRN
- No evidence of bacterial superinfection

### 3. **AKI secondary to shock (resolved)**
- Renal function now baseline
- Monitor BUN/Cr, maintain euvolemia

### 4. **Right wrist subluxation h/o**
- Healing well, no acute issues
- Ortho f/u as OP

### 5. **Pain/Agitation**
- PRN acetaminophen/ibuprofen
- Reassess pain q4h

### 6. **Nutrition**
- PO intake adequate
- Diet liberalized

### 7. **DVT Prophylaxis**
- SCDs while bedbound
- Consider LMWH if prolonged immobilization

### 8. **Psychosocial**
- Support for patient/family
- SW consult

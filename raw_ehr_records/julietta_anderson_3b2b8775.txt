**Patient Name:** Julietta Anderson  
**MRN:** 002938475  
**DOB:** 10/11/1998  
**Sex:** Female  
**Admit Date:** 02/03/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. Michael R. Evans  
**Location:** CVICU, Room 312B  
**Allergies:** NKDA

## CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain, found unresponsive at home.

---

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Julietta Anderson is a 25-year-old female with a known history of seizure disorder (single prior event, presumed provoked), perennial allergic rhinitis, viral sinusitis, and prior concussion (no LOC), who was brought in by EMS after being found unresponsive by her roommate. Per EMS, patient was cyanotic and required bag-mask ventilation en route. On arrival, BP 74/42, HR 127, RR 28, SpO2 88% on NRB. She was intubated for airway protection.

Initial workup notable for markedly elevated troponin, global hypokinesis on bedside echo, and lactic acidosis. She developed worsening hypotension despite escalating vasopressors and was subsequently placed on a percutaneous temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for presumed acute fulminant myocarditis vs. cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to viral etiology (recent URI symptoms).

**Day 4-6:**  
- Impella weaned and explanted on Day 5.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Fulminant Myocarditis (resolved)**
- Likely viral etiology, presenting as acute decompensated heart failure with shock.
- Required temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP) for 4 days.
- Plan: Continue GDMT for HF, follow-up TTE in 1 week, avoid strenuous activity x3 months, outpatient cardiology.

### 2. **Acute Respiratory Failure (intubated, now resolved)**
- Intubated for airway protection, extubated successfully on Day 3.
- Plan: Pulmonary hygiene, O2 as needed, incentive spirometry.

### 3. **Seizure Disorder (remote, no recent events)**
- EEG negative for epileptiform activity during ICU stay.
- No AEDs required. No witnessed seizure activity.
- Plan: Continue monitoring, outpatient neurology.

### 4. **Perennial Allergic Rhinitis / Viral Sinusitis**
- No acute exacerbation during this admission.
- Plan: Continue fexofenadine, monitor for symptoms.

### 5. **Concussion (no LOC, remote)**
- No acute issues.
- Plan: No restrictions.

### 6. **Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**
- Likely pre-renal from shock; creatinine peak 2.1, now back to baseline.
- Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins.

### 7. **Transaminitis (resolved)**
- Mild AST/ALT elevation, likely secondary to shock liver.
- Plan: Monitor LFTs.

### 8. **Anticoagulation (post-Impella)**
- Heparin infusion during device support, transitioned to prophylactic LMWH post-removal.
- Plan: Continue DVT prophylaxis.

### 9. **Infection Prophylaxis**
- Broad-spectrum abx stopped after negative cultures.
- Plan: No further antibiotics.

### 10. **Nutrition**
- Started on tube feeds while intubated, now tolerating regular diet.

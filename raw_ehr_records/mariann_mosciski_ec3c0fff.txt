### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Progressive shortness of breath, chest heaviness, and lower extremity swelling.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Mariann Mosciski is a 65-year-old woman with a history of prediabetes, chronic anemia, and hyperlipidemia who presented to the ED with 4 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, and new-onset paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She denied fever or cough but reported rhinorrhea and mild sore throat for 1 week prior, thought to be viral. She also noted decreased exercise tolerance, bilateral leg swelling, and a sensation of chest pressure radiating to her neck but no frank chest pain.  

On arrival, she was tachypneic, hypoxic, and found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with hypotension and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. She rapidly deteriorated in the ED, requiring ICU admission and escalating vasopressor support. Due to refractory cardiogenic shock, she underwent emergent placement of a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN (Problem-based)

**1. Cardiogenic Shock s/p Impella CP**  
- Cardiogenic shock likely due to acute viral myocarditis on background of chronic CV risk factors  
- Emergent Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support, now explanted  
- Continue GDMT for HFrEF, monitor for recurrence  
- Serial ECHOs, daily labs, fluid/volume status monitoring  

**2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (new HFrEF, LVEF 15–28%)**  
- Diuresis with IV then PO furosemide  
- Initiated beta-blocker (metoprolol) and ACEi (lisinopril) as tolerated  
- Salt/fluid restriction, daily weights  
- Cardiology to follow, consider outpatient advanced HF clinic  

**3. Anemia (multifactorial, acute on chronic)**  
- Ongoing hemolysis likely related to Impella  
- Monitored retic, LDH, haptoglobin; transfused 1 PRBC  
- B12 supplementation continued  
- Monitor for recovery, iron studies pending  

**4. Acute Kidney Injury**  
- Pre-renal, likely multifactorial (hypoperfusion, diuretics, hemolysis)  
- Improving with recovery of cardiac output and euvolemia  
- Monitor renal function, minimize nephrotoxins  

**5. Transaminitis**  
- Likely shock liver, resolving as hemodynamics improve  
- Monitor LFTs  

**6. Viral URI (Sinusitis/Pharyngitis)**  
- Supportive care, no antibiotics indicated  
- Symptom resolution  

**7. Prediabetes / Hyperlipidemia**  
- Counsel on lifestyle, initiate statin prior to discharge  
- Plan for outpatient DM screening  

**8. Delirium**  
- Resolved after extubation and improved perfusion  
- Monitor for recurrence  

**9. VTE Prophylaxis**  
- SCDs, heparin SQ started after bleeding risk decreased  

**10. Rehab Needs**  
- Physical therapy, nutrition consult  
- Plan for cardiac rehab after discharge  

---

### DISCHARGE PLANNING (anticipated)  
- To telemetry floor for ongoing diuresis, rehab  
- Close cardiology follow-up  
- Arrange outpatient echo, labs, advanced HF clinic  
- Education: Meds, diet, device precautions  
- Home health referral  

---

### ORDERS (selected)  
- Furosemide 40mg PO BID  
- Metoprolol succinate 25mg daily  
- Lisinopril 2.5mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 40mg daily  
- Vitamin B12 5mg IM weekly  
- Heparin 5000u SQ BID  
- Regular CBC, chem7, LFTs, troponin, BNP  
- Cardiac telemetry

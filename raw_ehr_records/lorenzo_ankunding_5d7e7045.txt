### **Chief Complaint**
Altered mental status, acute decompensated heart failure, respiratory distress

---

### **History of Present Illness**
Mr. Lorenzo Ankunding is a 40-year-old male with PMHx significant for epilepsy, HTN, obesity (BMI 30.1), and remote viral sinusitis, who presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and confusion. Family reports an episode of witnessed seizure at home (generalized tonic-clonic, 2-3 minutes, post-ictal ~15 min). In ED, he was hypoxic (SpO2 87% RA), hypertensive (BP 176/102), and tachycardic (HR 122). CXR showed pulmonary edema. Troponin I mildly elevated, BNP 3680. TTE: LVEF 15%, severe global hypokinesis. He rapidly deteriorated, requiring intubation and was transferred to MICU for acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Temporary left-sided heart pump (Impella CP) was placed for hemodynamic support on hospital day 2.

*Some labs missing due to hemolysis or sample clotting.*

## **Pertinent Imaging**

- **CXR (5/15):** Pulmonary vascular congestion, bilateral pleural effusions.
- **TTE (5/15):** LVEF 15%, severe diffuse hypokinesis, mild RV dysfunction, no LV thrombus.
- **Brain MRI (5/16):** No acute infarct/hemorrhage. Chronic microvascular changes.
- **Repeat TTE (5/22):** LVEF improved to 35% post-Impella, mild MR.

---

## **Hospital Course**

- **5/15:** Admitted with acute respiratory distress, seizure. Found to have severe new-onset systolic heart failure. Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Started on IV diuresis, levetiracetam, and BP control.
- **5/16:** Developed hypotension refractory to diuresis, rising creatinine, worsening lactic acidosis. Cardiogenic shock diagnosed. Impella CP placed. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine.
- **5/17-18:** Gradual improvement in perfusion, weaned off norepi by 5/19. Renal function improved with diuresis. No further seizures. EEG: diffuse slowing, no epileptiform activity.
- **5/19-21:** Impella support ongoing. Diuresis continued. Extubated 5/20, transitioned to BiPAP. Mobilizing with PT/OT. 
- **5/22:** Impella successfully weaned and removed. LVEF improved to 35%. Remains on low-dose diuretic, uptitrating guideline-directed HF therapy.
- **5/23:** Alert, oriented x3. No focal neuro deficits. Stable on room air.

## **Assessment and Plan**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Acute Systolic Heart Failure (new onset)**
   - Likely viral myocarditis (pending viral panel, coxsackie B IgM+)
   - Required Impella CP for 6 days, now explanted
   - Guideline-directed medical therapy: Start low-dose carvedilol, titrate up. Continue ACEi/ARB, consider SGLT2i.
   - Monitor for arrhythmias. Telemetry ongoing.
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os, continue IV Lasix, transition to oral as tolerated.

**2. Seizure Disorder/Epilepsy**
   - No recurrent seizures since admission
   - EEG: diffuse slowing, no epileptiform discharges
   - Continue levetiracetam 1000mg BID, monitor for sedation/encephalopathy
   - Neuro follow-up on floor

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, resolving)**
   - Likely secondary to hypoperfusion, improved with volume management
   - Monitor renal function daily
   - Avoid nephrotoxins

**4. Hypertension**
   - Previously poorly controlled, now low-normal BP
   - Restart home regimen once stable, titrate as tolerated

**5. Obesity (BMI 30.1)**
   - Dietician consult, low sodium, cardiac diet
   - Encourage mobilization, PT/OT

**6. History of Viral Sinusitis/Pharyngitis**
   - No current symptoms, no antibiotics needed

**7. Hospital-Related Issues**
   - VTE prophylaxis: SCDs, LMWH
   - Stress ulcer prophylaxis: pantoprazole
   - Monitor for ICU delirium
   - Foley removed 5/19

**Dispo:**  
Anticipate transfer to step-down unit in 24-48 hrs. Plan for cardiac rehab, close outpatient f/u with cardiology and neurology.

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive shortness of breath, chest pressure, and fatigue x 1 week. Presented to ED with acute decompensated heart failure and hypotension.

---

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mateo Verdugo is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history of obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, anemia, colon cancer s/p resection, and diabetic retinopathy who presented to the ED after several days of progressive SOB, orthopnea, and new-onset chest pressure. On arrival, he was found to be hypotensive (SBP 78 mmHg), tachycardic, and hypoxic. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Echo revealed severe global LV dysfunction (EF 18%). Troponin mildly elevated, no acute ECG changes. He developed worsening cardiogenic shock despite high-dose inotropes and was transferred to the CCU.

Given refractory shock, a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 1. Course complicated by AKI, fluctuating mentation, and anemia requiring transfusion. Oncology consulted for h/o colon cancer; no evidence of recurrent disease.

---

## HOSPITAL COURSE

- **Day 1:** Admitted to CCU. Impella placed for cardiogenic shock. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine, lasix drip, broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible pneumonia (fever 38.2°C, CXR opacities).
- **Day 2:** Improved MAPs. Weaned from norepinephrine. Lactate normalizing. Developed hemoglobin drop (from 10.4 → 7.2); transfused 2U PRBC. CT angio: No active bleed. Renal function stable.
- **Day 3-6:** Gradual improvement. Impella flows stable (3.2-3.8 L/min). Extubated on day 4. Diuresis continued. Worsening hyperglycemia, managed with insulin drip. Mild transaminitis noted.
- **Day 7:** Impella weaned off and removed. Echo: EF improved to 30%. Renal function recovered. Began transition to oral heart failure regimen.
- **Day 8-11:** Transferred to stepdown. Mobilization, physical therapy. Glycemic control improved. Discharged home with close cardiology and oncology follow-up.

### 2. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**
- Poorly controlled on admission (A1c 7.8%), stress hyperglycemia during ICU course
- On insulin drip in ICU, transitioned back to metformin + basal insulin
- Plan: Endocrine f/u, continue home regimen, reinforce DM education

### 3. **Anemia**
- Multifactorial: chronic disease, acute blood loss (iatrogenic, possible GI), dilutional
- Hgb nadir 7.2 (3/19), transfused 2U PRBC, now stable >11
- Plan: Monitor, avoid further phlebotomy, iron studies outpatient

### 4. **Colon Cancer (history of)**
- No evidence of recurrence on recent CT
- Follow-up with oncology as outpatient

### 5. **Hypertension**
- Poorly controlled prior, now on carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan
- Plan: Monitor, titrate as tolerated, avoid hypotension

### 6. **CKD Stage 2 (transient AKI)**
- Creatinine peaked at 1.6, now improved to 0.9
- Plan: Monitor, avoid nephrotoxins

### 7. **Obesity / Metabolic Syndrome**
- BMI 29, ongoing risk for CV events
- Plan: Nutrition consult, weight loss counseling, cardiac rehab referral

### 8. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
- Stable, no acute changes
- Plan: Continue annual eye exams

### 9. **Hypertriglyceridemia**
- Triglycerides 185 mg/dL on admission
- Plan: Resume statin/fibrate outpatient

### 10. **Viral Sinusitis / Acute Bronchitis (remote)**
- No active infection now
- Plan: PRN management

### ADMISSION SUMMARY

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest discomfort x 3 days.

**History of Present Illness:**  
38-year-old male with prediabetes, chronic anemia, and recent acute bronchitis/sinusitis (treated outpatient) who presented to ED with acute-on-chronic shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, and chest heaviness. Found to be hypoxic, tachycardic, and hypotensive. Rapid decompensation required intubation and vasopressor support. Bedside echo in ED showed severe global hypokinesis, LVEF estimated at 15%, LV dilatation. Troponin T elevated. Emergent decision made to place Impella CP for left-sided mechanical circulatory support. Transferred to Cardiac ICU.

- Chronic anemia (microcytic, under investigation, presumed iron deficiency)  
- Recent acute bronchitis and bacterial sinusitis  
- Remote laceration of forearm (s/p repair, healed)

**Past Surgical History:**  
- None

**Medications on Admission:**  
- Acetaminophen 325 mg PO Q6H PRN  
- Diphenhydramine 25 mg PO QHS PRN  
- No home cardiac meds

**Allergies:**  
- NKDA

**Social History:**  
- Lives alone, works as an accountant

## ICU HOSPITAL COURSE (Days 1-7)

**Day 1 (03/17/24):**  
- Intubated for hypoxemic resp failure.  
- Impella CP placed for cardiogenic shock (refractory to norepi + dobutamine).  
- Started on broad-spectrum abx given fever/leukocytosis (cefepime + vanc).  
- Lactate 4.1, troponin T 0.57 → 0.60.  
- Echo: LVEF 15%, no LV thrombus, mild MR, RV normal.  
- CXR: Pulmonary edema  
- Foley, A-line, central line placed.  
- Transfused 1U PRBC for Hgb 7.8.  
- Baseline anemia, iron studies pending.

**Day 2-3:**  
- Gradual improvement in MAP, weaned off norepi.  
- Still requiring Impella support, minimal native cardiac output.  
- Extubated on day 3.  
- Diuresed with IV furosemide, net negative 2L.  
- Cardiac MRI: non-ischemic pattern, possible viral myocarditis vs. idiopathic DCM.  
- Viral panel sent, all negative.  
- Iron studies: ferritin 28, Fe 22, TIBC 445.  
- ID: abx stopped after negative cultures, procalcitonin downtrending.

**Day 4-5:**  
- Improved urine output, euvolemic.  
- Impella wean trial attempted, borderline hemodynamics, kept in place.  
- Hgb stable (8.5-9.0).  
- Nutrition: started tube feeds, later advanced to soft diet.  
- Mild delirium, resolved with reorientation.  
- PT/OT eval: deconditioned, baseline functional mobility intact.

**Day 6-7:**  
- Impella explanted on day 7 after successful wean, LVEF improved to 30%.  
- Transitioned to oral heart failure regimen: carvedilol, lisinopril, spironolactone.  
- Discharged to telemetry floor for ongoing monitoring.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (Acute Systolic HF, suspected viral myocarditis):**  
- Severe biventricular dysfunction, LVEF 15% on admission.  
- Required Impella CP for hemodynamic support.  
- Improved to LVEF 30%, Impella explanted day 7.  
- Now on oral GDMT (carvedilol, lisinopril, spironolactone).  
- Plan: Continue up-titration as tolerated, monitor for recurrent decompensation, outpatient heart failure clinic f/u.  
- Cardiac MRI: non-ischemic, likely myocarditis; viral panel negative.

**2. Anemia (Chronic, Iron Deficiency):**  
- Baseline Hgb 7.8, transfused 1U PRBC on admission.  
- Iron studies: ferritin 28, Fe 22, TIBC 445 → iron deficiency.  
- Plan: Start oral iron, GI referral for occult blood loss evaluation.

**3. Prediabetes:**  
- A1c 6.0%.  
- No DKA/HHS during admission.  
- Plan: Lifestyle counseling, repeat A1c in 3 months, monitor while on steroids (if needed).

**4. Acute Bronchitis/Sinusitis (recent):**  
- Treated outpatient, no ongoing fevers, negative cultures.  
- Plan: No further antibiotics.

**5. Delirium (ICU, resolved):**  
- Likely multifactorial (sedation, critical illness).  
- Plan: Monitor, avoid benzos, reorient as needed.

**6. Deconditioning:**  
- ICU stay, now ambulating with PT/OT.  
- Plan: Daily PT/OT, consider inpatient rehab if slow progress.

**7. Electrolyte Abnormalities:**  
- Mild hypokalemia, resolved with supp.  
- Plan: Monitor lytes daily, replace as needed.

**8. Remote laceration, forearm:**  
- Well-healed, no signs of infection.

**9. Secondary Prevention:**  
- Statin started for cardiac risk reduction.  
- Smoking avoidance, dietician consult.

**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema x 2 weeks.

---

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  
76-year-old female with PMHx significant for obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, chronic kidney disease (baseline Cr ~2.2), osteoporosis, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and new LE swelling. She was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with evidence of cardiogenic shock (MAP ~58 mmHg, cool extremities, lactate 4.2). Despite initial stabilization attempts (IV diuresis, vasopressors), she developed worsening end-organ hypoperfusion with escalating inotropic requirements. Cardiology consulted, and decision made for temporary percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) placement in the CCU on HD #2.

Her course has been complicated by AKI (stage 3), labile blood sugars, and infection risk. She is currently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure (HD #3), on minimal sedation, and Impella support is ongoing. She is being evaluated for advanced therapies.

**PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (EF 18%)**
   - **Assessment:** Severe ADHF with shock, requiring Impella CP. Etiology likely ischemic + metabolic.
   - **Plan:**
     - Continue Impella support, daily device checks.
     - Wean vasopressors as tolerated.
     - Titrate diuretics (IV furosemide).
     - Cardiology: Advanced therapies eval (LVAD vs OHT).
     - Daily ECHO/flow assessment.
     - Strict I/O, daily weights.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury on CKD (Baseline Cr 2.2, peak 3.5)**
   - **Assessment:** Likely multifactorial—low flow, diuretics, nephrotoxin exposure.
   - **Plan:**
     - Avoid nephrotoxins.
     - Monitor lytes, daily chem7.
     - Renal dosing of all meds.
     - Nephrology following.
     - No indication for RRT at this time.

**3. Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus**
   - **Assessment:** Poor glycemic control, likely stress hyperglycemia.
   - **Plan:**
     - Hold metformin (AKI).
     - Sliding scale insulin, monitor q6h.
     - Endo consult if persistent.

**4. Infection Risk, Intubated**
   - **Assessment:** No current infection, high risk due to devices.
   - **Plan:**
     - Daily blood cultures if new fever.
     - VAP prevention bundle.
     - Remove lines/catheters ASAP.

**5. Hyperlipidemia/Hypertriglyceridemia/Metabolic Syndrome**
   - **Assessment:** Underlying risk factors.
   - **Plan:**
     - Statin continued.
     - Recheck lipids after stabilization.

**6. Osteoporosis**
   - **Assessment:** High risk for fracture.
   - **Plan:**
     - DVT/PE prophylaxis (heparin SQ).
     - PT/OT consult for post-ICU care.

**7. Pressure Injury Prevention**
   - **Assessment:** Mild sacral erythema.
   - **Plan:**
     - Frequent repositioning.
     - Air mattress.

**8. Nutrition**
   - **Assessment:** At risk, NPO for procedures.
   - **Plan:**
     - Enteral feeding via NGT.

**9. Delirium Sedation/Withdrawal**
   - **Assessment:** On minimal sedation, at risk for delirium.
   - **Plan:**
     - SAT/SBT daily.
     - Minimize sedation.

**10. Disposition**
   - **Assessment:** MICU, needs advanced HF therapy eval.
   - **Plan:**
     - Social work, case management involved.
     - Family updated daily.

---

**PROGRESS/TO DO:**  
- Continue current management, monitor for extubation readiness.  
- Daily labs, strict input/output.  
- Impella weaning trial if hemodynamically stable.  
- Continue family updates.  
- Reassess for transfer to stepdown when off Impella/pressors.

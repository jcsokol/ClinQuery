===============================
ADMISSION SUMMARY
===============================
Chief Complaint: Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema

HPI:
Lavern Gusikowski is an 88-year-old male with a history of chronic congestive heart failure (EF last known 38%), CAD, prostate neoplasm, anemia, opioid use disorder, and remote appendectomy, who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening dyspnea, new-onset confusion, and abdominal discomfort. He had recently been treated for acute bronchitis and has a history of hyperlipidemia and colon polyps.

On arrival, he was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with hypotension (SBP 82 mmHg), hypoxemia (O2 sat 88% on RA), and acute kidney injury. He rapidly developed cardiogenic shock and was transferred to the CCU, where he required vasopressor support and ultimately placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for temporary circulatory support. He has had a complicated ICU course including AKI, volume overload, and episodes of delirium.

===============================
CARDIAC IMAGING
===============================
3/1/24 ECHO: LVEF 32%, severe global hypokinesis, moderate MR, moderate TR, RV systolic function mildly reduced. IVC plethoric. No pericardial effusion.

===============================
HOSPITAL COURSE (ICU)
===============================
Day 1-2: Admitted with acute decompensated heart failure, presumed ischemic. Required escalating O2, then BiPAP. Vasopressors (norepi, then low-dose dobutamine). Acute kidney injury worsened. Oliguric, rising creatinine.

Day 2: Developed hypotension refractory to pressors, rising lactate. Bedside ECHO: severe LV dysfunction, low cardiac output (CI 1.2). Decision made for percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) placement. Procedure at bedside, tolerated well. Anticoag started.

Day 3-5: Gradual hemodynamic stabilization. Weaned off norepi, dobutamine. Renal function initially worsened, then improved with volume management. Diuresis with IV furosemide. Confusion improved. LFTs peaked then trended down. Cardiac enzymes trended.

Day 6-8: Impella weaned, removed on day 7. Maintained MAP >65 mmHg off pressors. Diuresis continued. O2 requirements downtrended. Mobilized to chair. Appetite improved.

Day 9: Transferred to stepdown. Creatinine near baseline. No further arrhythmia, stable volume status.

===============================
PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN
===============================
**1. Cardiogenic Shock (Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure)**
   - Etiology: Ischemic, severe LV dysfunction (EF 32%), rapid decompensation
   - Management: Pressors, inotropes, rapid escalation to temporary LVAD (Impella CP)
   - Anticoagulation for device
   - Serial echo monitoring
   - Diuresis as tolerated
   - Weaned and explanted Impella after 5 days, now stable

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (on CKD)**
   - Multifactorial: hypoperfusion, cardiorenal, diuretic effect
   - Monitored UOP, daily lytes, renal dose adjustments
   - Renal function improved with improved cardiac output and diuresis

**3. Volume Overload/Pulmonary Edema**
   - Treated with IV loop diuretics, strict I/O, daily weights
   - Monitored for electrolyte disturbances

**4. Anemia**
   - Baseline chronic, mild drop with hemodilution/AKI
   - Monitored H/H, no transfusion needed

**5. Prostate Cancer/Neoplasm**
   - Onc consulted, continued leuprolide and docetaxel
   - No evidence of infection/neutropenia

**6. Opioid Use Disorder**
   - On methadone maintenance, no withdrawal
   - Monitored for delirium, pain management coordinated

**7. Hyperlipidemia**
   - Continue statin

**8. Delirium**
   - Multifactorial: hypoxemia, uremia, ICU environment
   - Improved with correction of underlying issues

**9. Remote Appendectomy, Colon Polyp, Concussion**
   - No acute issues

**10. Prophylaxis**
   - DVT: SCDs, heparin held during Impella, resumed after removal
   - GI: PPI

===============================
DISCHARGE PLANNING
===============================
- To stepdown, then home with home health
- Cardiology follow-up in 1 week
- Home meds: Continue HF regimen, statin, anticoag x2 weeks post-Impella
- Outpatient echo in 2 weeks
- Close monitoring for recurrent decompensation

===============================
ADDITIONAL NOTES
===============================
- No new colonoscopy indicated at this time
- No evidence of active infection during this admission
- No overt GI bleeding
- Code status: Full, discussed with family

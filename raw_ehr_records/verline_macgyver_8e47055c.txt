**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**  
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and chest discomfort x 1 week.  

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  
52-year-old female with PMH significant for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (A1c 7.3), obesity (BMI ~29-30), chronic anemia, metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, presented from home with 6 days of worsening SOB, orthopnea, and 2-pillow PND. She also reported decreased urine output and lightheadedness. On arrival to ED, found to be tachycardic (HR 122), hypotensive (BP 88/54), hypoxic (SpO2 89% RA), with evidence of pulmonary edema and jugular venous distension. Troponin mildly elevated. CXR showed pulmonary vascular congestion.  
She rapidly developed cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressors and was transferred to the ICU. Echo revealed EF 18%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR. Given ongoing hemodynamic instability despite inotropes, decision made to place a percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) on hospital day 2. She has since stabilized hemodynamically, weaning off pressors.

**PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

1. **Cardiogenic Shock (Acute Decompensated Systolic HF, EF 18%, likely ischemic/cardiometabolic):**
   - Impella CP placed HD2 for refractory shock, removed HD8 after improvement.
   - Dobutamine/epi titrated off by HD6.
   - Serial Echos: improvement in EF.
   - Continue guideline-directed med therapy (BB, ACEi, diuresis, statin).
   - Monitor for arrhythmias, LV thrombus.
   - Cardiac rehab consult.

2. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (A1c 7.3, retinopathy):**
   - Glucose managed with basal/bolus insulin while NPO/unstable.
   - Restarted metformin, continue statin.
   - Ophtho to follow-up post-discharge.

3. **Anemia (Hgb nadir 10.1, chronic):**
   - Multifactorial (chronic disease, dilutional).
   - No evidence of acute blood loss.
   - Iron studies pending, folate/B12 borderline.
   - Monitor CBC; consider EPO if persistent.

4. **AKI on CKD (Cr peaked at 1.7, baseline ~0.85):**
   - Pre-renal, improved with diuresis and hemodynamic stabilization.
   - Now at baseline.

5. **Obesity/Metabolic Syndrome/Hypertriglyceridemia:**
   - Dietician consult.
   - Continue statin, dietary modification.
   - Encourage exercise, weight loss plan.

6. **Infection (Fever, leukocytosis HD5-6):**
   - Empiric vanc/cefepime, no positive cultures, abx stopped after 72hr.
   - Source unclear, possibly device-related/line infection.

7. **Other comorbidities (Rhinitis, sinusitis, remote ankle sprain):**
   - Not contributing to current admission.
   - Continue supportive care.

# HOSPITAL COURSE

Patient presented with anterior STEMI, complicated by cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema. Emergent cardiac cath revealed 100% proximal LAD occlusion, with unsuccessful PCI due to no-reflow. Developed worsening hypotension and hypoxia requiring norepinephrine and high-flow O2. TTE: LVEF 15%, severe global hypokinesis.

Given refractory shock, decision was made to place a temporary left-sided ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support. Following device placement, patient stabilized on minimal vasopressors. Over ensuing days, patient gradually improved with diuresis and weaning of support. Complicated by AKI (peak Cr 2.3), mild transaminitis, and delirium.

---

# Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

**1. Cardiogenic Shock s/p STEMI, Impella Support**  
- Emergent Impella CP placed day 1  
- Weaned off norepinephrine by day 3  
- Serial TTE: LVEF improved to 25% by day 7  
- Plan: Continue Impella, daily echo, wean as tolerated

**2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**  
- IV furosemide initiated, net negative 2.5L by day 4  
- Euvolemic by day 5  
- Plan: Slow diuresis, monitor electrolytes

**3. Acute Kidney Injury**  
- Likely multifactorial (low flow, contrast)  
- Cr up to 2.3, trending down (see labs)  
- Plan: Renal dose adjust meds, monitor UOP, nephrology consult

**4. Obesity**  
- BMI 29  
- Dietician consult, calorie restriction

**5. Delirium**  
- Likely multifactorial (ICU, metabolic, infection)  
- Reoriented, sleep-wake cycle normalization  
- Plan: Minimize sedation, daily PT/OT

**6. Sinusitis**  
- Viral, on amox-clav prophylactically  
- No purulent discharge or fevers  
- Plan: Monitor, d/c abx if no signs of bacterial infection

**7. Pain Control**  
- Oxycodone/acetaminophen PRN  
- Pain scores improving

**8. DVT Prophylaxis**  
- SCDs, SQ heparin

**9. Nutrition**  
- NPO x 24h, now on cardiac diet, PO intake improving

**10. Disposition**  
- Remains in ICU  
- Will reassess for step-down once off Impella & stable

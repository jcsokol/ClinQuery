### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Acute dyspnea, weakness, and syncopal episode at home.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Felix Gutmann is an 89-year-old male with a complex past medical history (see below), who presented to the ED after being found unresponsive at home by his daughter. She reported he had complained of increasing shortness of breath, confusion, and decreased oral intake over 3 days prior to admission. On arrival, he was hypotensive, tachycardic, and hypoxic. Initial ECG showed rapid atrial fibrillation with RVR. Troponin mildly elevated. Bedside echo demonstrated severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF ~20%), globally hypokinetic, with moderate MR. He was admitted to the CICU for management of acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock.  

Given persistent hypotension and end-organ hypoperfusion despite vasopressors and inotropes, a decision was made to place a percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (HFrEF, EF 20%)**  
- Likely precipitated by rapid AFib and underlying ischemic and valvular heart disease  
- Required Impella CP for hemodynamic support (placed HD2, L femoral)  
- Off vasopressors x48hr, MAPs stable ~70  
- Weaning Impella flow from 3.5 to 2.0 L/min, plan for device removal pending hemodynamic stability  
- Continue daily TTEs, monitor for hemolysis  
- Strict I/Os, daily weights  
- Diuresis with IV furosemide, but slow due to AKI  
- Continue guideline-directed med therapy as tolerated (hold ACEi for now due to hypotension)

**2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR**  
- Initially rate uncontrolled, now HR 80-100  
- On digoxin and verapamil, monitor for bradycardia  
- Anticoagulation with warfarin (INR goal 2-3)  
- No plans for rhythm control at this time

**3. Acute Kidney Injury on CKD**  
- Likely multifactorial: cardiorenal, pre-renal, nephrotoxin exposure  
- Creatinine peaked at 1.9, now improved to 1.3  
- Monitor lytes, trend BUN/Cr, avoid nephrotoxins

**4. Anemia (chronic, multifactorial)**  
- Baseline Hgb ~9.2, nadir 7.8 (HD3), transfused 1U PRBC  
- Monitoring for GI bleeding (Hemoccult + stool, see labs)  
- Iron studies pending

**5. Prostate Cancer, s/p docetaxel/leuprolide**  
- Continue therapy as outpatient  
- Monitor for cytopenias, infectious complications

**6. Osteoporosis**  
- On alendronate  
- Fall precautions, PT/OT ordered  
- Calcium/vitamin D supplementation

**7. Alzheimer’s Disease**  
- Baseline mild dementia, now with delirium (likely multifactorial: metabolic, ICU, infection)  
- Avoid benzos, ensure sleep-wake cycle, re-orient frequently

**8. Tobacco Dependence**  
- Continue nicotine patch  
- Smoking cessation counseling when able

**9. Infection Risk**  
- Chronic sinusitis, now with intermittent fevers  
- Blood, urine, sputum cultures x2 negative  
- CXR: mild RLL atelectasis, no PNA  
- Empiric ceftriaxone started HD4, stopped HD6

**10. VTE Prophylaxis**  
- On warfarin for AFib, monitor INR

**11. Nutrition**  
- NPO x2d, now on cardiac diet, tolerating PO  
- Dietician consult, replete electrolytes as needed

**12. Pressure Ulcer Prevention**  
- Sacral erythema, frequent turns, barrier cream

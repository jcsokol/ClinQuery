## Hospital Course Summary

**Day 1:**  
- Admitted to ICU for cardiogenic shock.
- Initial labs: Troponin mildly elevated, BNP 1340, lactate 3.8.
- TTE: Severe global hypokinesis, LVEF 18%, mild RV dysfunction.
- Started on norepinephrine and dobutamine.
- Invasive monitoring via Swan-Ganz: CI 1.6, wedge 27, SVR 900.
- Infectious w/u sent; started broad-spectrum abx empirically.
- Cardiology: Suspected acute myocarditis vs. peripartum cardiomyopathy.

**Day 2:**  
- Worsening hypotension and hypoxia despite inotropes/pressors.
- Emergent placement of temporary LVAD (Impella CP) at bedside.
- Hemodynamics improved; pressors weaned.
- Ongoing mild hemolysis, elevated LDH.
- Repeat echo: LVEF improved to 25% on support.

**Day 3:**  
- Weaning inotropes.  
- Started diuresis (furosemide drip).
- Infectious w/u negative; abx d/c’d.
- Monitored for LVAD complications (bleeding, hemolysis, arrhythmias).

**Day 4:**  
- Gradual improvement; LVAD wean trial started.
- Echo: LVEF 30%, moderate MR.
- Mildly elevated liver enzymes, likely due to hypoperfusion.

**Day 5:**  
- LVAD explanted after successful wean.
- Transferred to stepdown unit.
- Stable, ambulating, tolerating diet.

# Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock (Acute Severe LV Dysfunction)
- Likely etiology: Acute myocarditis vs. peripartum cardiomyopathy.
- Required temporary LVAD for hemodynamic support.
- Serial TTEs to monitor LVEF.
- Monitor for arrhythmias, LVAD-related complications (bleeding, hemolysis, infection).
- Plan: Continue GDMT for HF, cardiac MRI after stabilization, f/u with heart failure clinic.

## 2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
- Secondary to pulmonary edema.
- Diuresis (furosemide), O2 support as needed.
- Monitor ABG, CXR.

## 3. Mild Hepatic Dysfunction
- Likely ischemic hepatitis ("shock liver").
- Monitor LFTs, trend down with improved perfusion.

## 4. Anemia & Hemolysis
- Mild, likely secondary to LVAD.
- Monitor CBC, LDH, haptoglobin.
- No transfusions needed.

## 5. Recent Pregnancy
- G1P1, delivered 2 months ago.
- OB/GYN consult; no current complications.

## 6. Contraception
- Restarted OCPs (Seasonique) after discussion with OB/GYN.

## 7. Rotator Cuff Injury (L)
- Chronic, not contributing to current admission.

## 8. Viral Sinusitis / Otitis Media
- No active infection, no antibiotics needed.

## 9. DVT Prophylaxis
- SCDs, low-dose enoxaparin while on LVAD.

## 10. Nutrition
- Monitored, started on cardiac diet.

## CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, progressive dyspnea, and hypotension.

---

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Cordell Kris is a 106-year-old male with a history of severe pulmonary emphysema, chronic sinusitis, remote CVA, and recent streptococcal pharyngitis, who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough, and subjective fevers. The patient was found to be tachypneic and hypoxemic on arrival (O2 sat 81% on RA), with bilateral rales and accessory muscle use. He was admitted to the MICU for acute on chronic respiratory failure and possible pneumonia.

On hospital day 2, Mr. Kris developed acute hypotension (SBP 70s) and altered mentation. Bedside echocardiogram showed severely depressed LV systolic function (EF ~15%) and global hypokinesis. Troponin was elevated (see labs). Given progressive shock and evidence of end-organ dysfunction, a decision was made to place a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support. He was transferred to the cardiac ICU for ongoing management.

# ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Severe LV Dysfunction (likely ischemic/acute on chronic)**
   - Impella CP placed for temporary support, now removed.
   - Wean inotropes/pressors, monitor for recurrence of shock.
   - Continue cardiac monitoring, daily TTEs, titrate diuretics.
   - Consider advanced heart failure therapies if recovery incomplete.

**2. Acute on Chronic Hypercapnic and Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (Emphysema)**
   - Extubated, now on HFNC (40% FiO2, 40 LPM).
   - Continue inhaled bronchodilators, steroids taper.
   - Pulmonary toilet, chest PT.
   - Monitor ABGs, wean O2 as tolerated.

**3. Volume Overload/Acute Kidney Injury**
   - Diuresis with IV furosemide.
   - Monitor daily weights, strict I/O.
   - Renal function trending up, avoid nephrotoxins.

**4. Infection/Pneumonia**
   - Ceftriaxone/azithromycin completed (5-day course).
   - Blood and sputum cultures negative.
   - Monitor for nosocomial infection.

**5. Chronic Sinusitis**
   - ENT to follow; nasal saline, topical steroids.
   - No acute intervention currently.

**6. Remote CVA**
   - Baseline mild right hemiparesis.
   - PT/OT for early mobilization, DVT prophylaxis.

**7. Nutrition**
   - NGT in place, enteral feeds started.
   - Monitor for refeeding, adjust caloric goals.

**8. Delirium/ICU Psychosis**
   - Minimize sedation, promote sleep-wake cycles.
   - Family at bedside.

**9. Skin Integrity**
   - Sacral erythema, frequent repositioning.
   - Wound care consult.

**10. Secondary Prevention**
   - Continue statin, low-dose ASA.
   - Optimize blood pressure control.

---

# DISPOSITION
- Continue in Cardiac ICU for close monitoring.
- Anticipate transfer to stepdown when hemodynamically stable off inotropes.
- Discuss with advanced HF team re: long-term options if recovery plateaus.

**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  
56-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension, T2DM, hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic syndrome, chronic sinusitis, and osteoarthritis of the hip, presenting with 2 weeks of progressive DOE, PND, and 10-lb weight gain. Symptoms worsened over 48 hrs prior to admission with new orthopnea and mild confusion. On arrival, found to be tachycardic, hypertensive, and hypoxic (O2 sat 88% RA). CXR: pulmonary edema. Echo: LVEF 20%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR. Admitted to ICU for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), rapidly developing cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic support (dobutamine) and subsequently insertion of a temporary percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) on hospital day 2.

### HOSPITAL COURSE OVERVIEW

- **Day 1:** Admitted to ICU for ADHF, started on IV furosemide, dobutamine, and nitroglycerin.  
- **Day 2:** Worsening perfusion, rising lactate (3.2 mmol/L), hypotension refractory to inotropes. Impella CP placed via right femoral access.  
- **Day 3:** Hemodynamics improved, weaned off dobutamine. Started on low-dose carvedilol.  
- **Day 4-5:** Diuresis continued, improved oxygenation, Impella settings gradually reduced.  
- **Day 6:** Impella weaned and explanted at bedside. Remains on IV diuretics, transitioned to subcutaneous insulin for hyperglycemia.  
- **Day 7:** Stable, transferred out of ICU to telemetry.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (HFrEF, new dx)**
   - Admitted in cardiogenic shock, likely ischemic vs. non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   - Required temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP).
   - Now off inotropes and Impella, euvolemic, MAP stable.
   - Plan: Continue aggressive diuresis, initiate guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF, cardiac MRI pending, consider coronary angiography if tolerated.

**2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**
   - Uncontrolled, A1c 7.2% on admission, stress hyperglycemia during ICU stay.
   - Now on sliding-scale insulin, hold oral agents due to AKI risk.
   - Plan: Endocrinology consult, transition to oral agents as renal function improves, diabetes education.

**3. Hypertension**
   - Difficult to control during shock, now stable.
   - Restarted low-dose ACEi and carvedilol, continue HCTZ.
   - Monitor for hypotension as GDMT titrated.

**4. Hypertriglyceridemia / Metabolic Syndrome**
   - On statin therapy, continue current regimen.
   - Dietician consult for cardiac/diabetic diet.
   - Plan: Recheck lipid panel prior to discharge.

**5. Chronic Sinusitis / Osteoarthritis**
   - No acute issues during this admission.
   - Naproxen held during AKI, acetaminophen for pain.
   - Resume chronic meds as renal function recovers.

**6. AKI (pre-renal, resolved)**
   - Likely due to hypoperfusion during cardiogenic shock.
   - Creatinine peaked at 1.6, now improved to 1.2.
   - Plan: Monitor daily, avoid nephrotoxins.

**7. Hospital-acquired anemia**
   - Hgb dropped from 14.8 to 10.4 over 5 days (hemodilution, phlebotomy, no overt bleeding).
   - Plan: Monitor, iron studies pending.

**8. DVT Prophylaxis / Immobility**
   - On SQ heparin, SCDs.
   - Encourage early mobilization post-Impella.

**9. Discharge Planning**
   - Awaiting cardiac MRI, GDMT titration.
   - Needs outpatient HF clinic follow-up, home health nursing referral.

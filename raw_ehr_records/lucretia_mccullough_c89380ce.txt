**EPIC EHR: Inpatient Progress Note**

**Patient:** Lucretia McCullough  
**MRN:** 002146781  
**DOB:** 04/06/1941 (Age: 83)  
**Sex:** Female  
**Date of Admission:** 05/03/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. Mark E. Sheehan, MD  
**Primary Team:** Cardiology/ICU  
**Consults:** Cardiac Surgery, Infectious Disease, Neurology

### CHIEF COMPLAINT

Shortness of breath, progressive fatigue, orthopnea; found hypoxic at home by family.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Lucretia McCullough is an 83-year-old female with a complex medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic sinusitis, early-onset familial Alzheimer’s, and a remote history of tubal pregnancy and miscarriage. She presented with 3 days of worsening dyspnea, productive cough, and confusion per family. She was seen in the ED, found to be hypoxic (O2 sat 84% on RA), tachycardic, and hypotensive. Chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates. She was admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, complicated by acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock. She required ICU transfer and was placed on noninvasive ventilation, then intubated for refractory hypoxemia.

On hospital day 2, she developed worsening hypotension despite escalating vasopressors. Echo revealed severely reduced LV function (EF ~15%), global hypokinesis, and elevated filling pressures. Given persistent shock and evidence of end-organ dysfunction, a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed at bedside for hemodynamic support.

### HOSPITAL COURSE

- Developed cardiogenic shock, AKI, lactic acidosis → temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placed
- Started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, azithromycin), vasopressors
- Gradual improvement in hemodynamics over 3 days, weaned off pressors day 5
- Renal function improved after volume optimization, but remains above baseline
- Developed mild thrombocytopenia (lowest plt 112 on 5/6), likely multifactorial (sepsis, device)
- Persistent delirium, severe baseline dementia
- Family meeting held on 5/7: Goals of care discussed; DNR/DNI confirmed, comfort measures to be considered if further deterioration

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

#### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, New HFrEF**
- Likely secondary to severe sepsis (pneumonia) and ischemic insult
- Temporary Impella CP support placed, now weaning
- Continue cardiac monitoring, daily TTEs, wean inotropes as tolerated
- Statin, beta-blocker held for hypotension

#### 2. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, Pneumonia**
- On day 5 of cefepime/azithromycin, sputum cx pending
- Ventilator weaning protocol initiated
- Continue pulmonary hygiene, chest PT

#### 3. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), on CKD**
- Likely pre-renal (shock), some ATN from sepsis
- IVF as tolerated, monitor for overload
- Avoid nephrotoxins, daily labs

#### 4. **Severe Dementia (Alzheimer’s)**
- Baseline severe, MMSE 4/30
- Nonverbal, dependent for all ADLs
- Family updated daily, POLST honored

#### 5. **Thrombocytopenia**
- Likely multifactorial (sepsis, device, dilutional)
- Monitor CBC, no active bleeding
- Consider heparin-induced thrombocytopenia if plts <100k

#### 6. **Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia**
- Home meds held for hypotension
- Resume as tolerated after stabilization

#### 7. **Chronic Sinusitis**
- No active issues

#### 8. **Other**
- DVT prophylaxis with SCDs
- PPI for GI prophylaxis
- Nutrition: NGT feeds, goal calories 1500/day

### DISPOSITION

- Continue ICU monitoring, likely prolonged course
- Prognosis guarded, high risk for further complications
- Anticipate palliative care involvement

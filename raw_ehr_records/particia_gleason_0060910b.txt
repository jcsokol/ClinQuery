## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
20-year-old female with history notable for ADHD (on atomoxetine), OCP use (Yaz), and recent viral upper respiratory tract infections presents with 4 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and intermittent chest tightness. She developed acute viral pharyngitis and bronchitis one week prior, managed outpatient with acetaminophen. Over the past 48 hours, she developed progressive weakness, mild confusion, and decreased urine output. She was brought to the ED by her family after an episode of near-syncope.

On arrival, noted to be tachycardic (HR 128), hypotensive (BP 82/54), tachypneic (RR 26), and hypoxic (SpO2 91% RA). CXR showed pulmonary edema. TTE revealed severe global LV dysfunction (EF 15%), RV mildly reduced, no significant valvular disease. Labs notable for lactic acidosis, elevated troponin, and transaminitis. Cardiology consulted for acute cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to fulminant viral myocarditis.

She was transferred to the MICU for advanced support. After failing to stabilize on high-dose vasopressors/inotropes, the decision was made to place a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for temporary mechanical circulatory support.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**20F with fulminant viral myocarditis (Coxsackie B), acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock, AKI, and respiratory failure.**

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock / Fulminant Myocarditis**
- Initial presentation with profound shock, severe LV dysfunction, and end-organ hypoperfusion.
- Required Impella CP for temporary circulatory support; device removed after cardiac function improved.
- Off vasopressors, now on gentle diuresis.
- Echo: EF improved to 38%.
- **Plan:** Continue close hemodynamic monitoring, daily weights, cautious diuresis, repeat TTE in 48h.

### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**
- Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, shock, possible nephrotoxic meds.
- Creatinine peaked at 2.3, now trending down.
- Good urine output.
- **Plan:** Monitor UOP, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal dosing, trend labs.

### 3. **Respiratory Failure**
- Intubated for hypoxia, likely multifactorial (pulmonary edema, infection).
- Successfully extubated on day 5.
- **Plan:** Incentive spirometry, monitor for reintubation criteria.

### 4. **Transaminitis**
- Likely ischemic hepatitis (shock liver).
- AST/ALT trending down.
- **Plan:** Monitor LFTs.

### 5. **Arrhythmia (AF)**
- Developed rapid AF, reverted with amiodarone.
- No recurrence.
- **Plan:** Continue telemetry, PRN amiodarone.

### 6. **Volume Overload**
- Ongoing diuresis with IV furosemide.
- **Plan:** Daily weights, strict I/O, adjust diuretics.

### 7. **Other**
- ADHD, continue home atomoxetine as tolerated.
- OCPs held during acute illness.
- VTE prophylaxis with heparin SQ.

### 8. **Disposition**
- Remain in ICU for close monitoring.
- If stable x24-48h, consider step-down transfer.

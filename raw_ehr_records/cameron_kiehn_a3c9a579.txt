## **Chief Complaint**
Cardiac arrest s/p resuscitation and temporary LVAD placement.

---

## **HPI**
Cameron Kiehn is a 17-year-old male with a past medical history of viral sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and a recent out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who was admitted after successful field resuscitation. He developed recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock requiring escalation to inotropes and ultimately placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for circulatory support. He is post-ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation), intubated, deeply sedated, and remains in the ICU with multi-disciplinary management.

---

## **Hospital Course**
**05/04/24:**  
- Found unresponsive at home, CPR initiated by bystander.
- EMS arrived, defibrillated for VFib, ROSC achieved after 2 rounds of epi + 300mg amio.
- Transported to ED, intubated, started on norepinephrine for hypotension.
- Initial labs: acidosis, elevated troponin, mild transaminitis.

**05/05/24:**  
- Developed recurrent VT despite amiodarone and lidocaine.
- Echo: severe global hypokinesis, LVEF ~20%.
- Cardiology consulted; decision made to place temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for ongoing cardiogenic shock.
- Admitted to PICU, started on heparin infusion.

**05/06/24 - 05/09/24:**  
- Gradual improvement in end-organ perfusion.
- Weaned off norepinephrine by 05/07.
- LVAD flows stable, no device alarms.
- Neurologic exam: sedated, but reactive pupils, intermittent spontaneous movement.
- Infectious work-up negative for bacterial causes; viral sinusitis resolved.
- Mild transaminitis resolved.
- Plan for LVAD wean and extubation trial.

## **Assessment & Plan**

### 1. **Cardiac Arrest, S/P ROSC, Cardiogenic Shock**
- **Background:** Likely arrhythmic arrest, possibly secondary to myocarditis vs. inherited channelopathy (workup pending).
- **Course:** Required multiple rounds of ACLS, developed refractory shock, placed on temporary LVAD (Impella CP).
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue LVAD support, daily echo to assess function.
  - Gradual wean of inotropes/vasopressors.
  - Cardiology and electrophysiology consults.
  - Monitor for arrhythmias, telemetry.
  - Consider cardiac MRI, genetic workup for channelopathies.

### 2. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, Intubated**
- **Plan:**
  - Ventilator support, wean as tolerated.
  - Daily CXR, pulmonary toilet.
  - Monitor for VAP.

### 3. **Transaminitis, Resolved**
- **Plan:**
  - LFTs trending down, likely ischemic hepatitis.
  - No intervention needed.

### 4. **Mild Acute Kidney Injury, Resolved**
- **Plan:**
  - Renal function improved with restoration of perfusion.
  - Monitor I/Os, daily BMP.

### 5. **Viral Sinusitis / Bronchitis, Resolved**
- **Plan:**
  - No evidence of ongoing infection.
  - Supportive care only.

### 6. **Sedation/Pain**
- **Plan:**
  - Continue propofol/fentanyl as needed.
  - Daily sedation vacation.

### 7. **Anticoagulation**
- **Plan:**
  - Continue heparin drip for LVAD.
  - Monitor aPTT, signs of bleeding.

### 8. **Nutrition**
- **Plan:**
  - NPO, NG feeds started.
  - Monitor electrolytes.

### 9. **Social/Disposition**
- **Plan:**
  - Family updated daily.
  - SW/Case Management involved for potential rehab placement.

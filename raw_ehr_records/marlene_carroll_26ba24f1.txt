### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Marlene Carroll is a 77-year-old female with a history of gout (on colchicine and allopurinol), osteoporosis (on alendronic acid), and remote miscarriage, who presented to the ED with 5 days of progressive dyspnea, PND, and bilateral leg swelling. She denied chest pain but did endorse mild cough and fatigue. Notable for acute viral pharyngitis 2 weeks ago, resolved.

On arrival, she was tachypneic, hypotensive (BP 82/55), and hypoxic (SaO2 89% RA). She rapidly deteriorated and required ICU admission for cardiogenic shock. Emergent bedside echo revealed severe global LV dysfunction (EF ~15%), moderate MR, and dilated LV. She was started on dobutamine and norepinephrine. Due to persistent shock (cold/clammy, worsening lactate, declining urine output), she underwent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 1.

---

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY  
- Day 1: Admitted to CICU, intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, Impella CP placed for cardiogenic shock.  
- Day 2-3: Persistent low cardiac output, slow improvement in renal function, weaned off norepinephrine.  
- Day 4: Echo with improved LV function (EF ~25%). Trials of Impella wean initiated.  
- Day 5: Extubated, transitioned to milrinone and low-dose diuresis.  
- Day 6-7: Impella removed, transitioned to high-flow nasal cannula, aggressive diuresis, downtrending BNP.  
- Day 8: Transferred to step-down unit, stable off inotropes, ambulating with PT.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock s/p Impella CP**  
- Severe new-onset systolic heart failure, likely viral myocarditis vs. ischemic.  
- Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support, now weaned and removed.  
- Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): low-dose metoprolol, lisinopril initiated.  
- Monitor for arrhythmia, volume status, daily weights, strict I/Os.  
- Cardiac rehab consult.  
- Plan outpatient cardiac MRI.

**2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**  
- Diuresed with IV furosemide, transitioned to oral.  
- Fluid balance negative ~5L since admission.  
- Continue electrolyte monitoring, adjust diuretics as needed.

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**  
- Pre-renal etiology, improved with cardiac output restoration.  
- Renal function now stable.

**4. Gout**  
- Continue allopurinol and colchicine.  
- Monitor for flares with diuresis.

**5. Osteoporosis**  
- Continue alendronic acid.  
- Fall precautions, PT/OT.

**6. Hyperlipidemia**  
- Continue statin therapy.

**7. Deconditioning**  
- Early mobilization, PT/OT daily.

**8. Psychosocial/Discharge Planning**  
- SW and case management involved; will likely need SNF placement post-discharge.

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Ms. Rolfson is a 71-year-old woman with a complex medical history (see PMHx below) who presented with acute chest pain and dyspnea. She was found to have an anterior STEMI with profound hypotension and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. She was admitted to the CCU, where she subsequently developed cardiogenic shock refractory to pressors and inotropes. The decision was made to proceed with percutaneous placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support. Her course was complicated by acute kidney injury (now resolving), anemia requiring transfusion, and persistent hyperglycemia. She was successfully weaned off the device on hospital day 5 and is currently being managed on the cardiac stepdown unit.

### HPI

26-year-old male with history of chronic sinusitis, intractable migraine without aura, chronic pain, and impacted molars, on chronic opioids, who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest heaviness. He was found to be hypotensive (SBP 78 mmHg), tachycardic, with cool extremities and JVD. Troponin I was elevated, BNP 1340, EKG with sinus tachycardia, no STEMI. Echo: severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF 18%), mild RV dysfunction. Required vasopressors and was transferred to CVICU. Over the next 12 hours, developed worsening end-organ hypoperfusion (Cr increased from 1.2 to 2.6 mg/dL, lactate 5.2), and a decision was made to place a percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for temporary circulatory support.

### ICU Course Summary

- **Day 1-2:** Vasopressor-dependent, oliguric, started on dobutamine and norepinephrine. O2 sat 92% on NRB. 
- **Day 2:** Impella CP placed via femoral access. Hemodynamics improved, pressors weaned.  
- **Day 3:** Some improvement in end-organ perfusion, but ongoing volume overload. Diuresis started.  
- **Day 4:** Developed fever (Tmax 38.6°C), WBC 12.3. Blood cultures sent, started empiric vanc/cefepime.  
- **Day 5:** Afebrile, negative cultures, abx stopped. Impella settings reduced.  
- **Day 6:** Weaned off Impella, device explanted at bedside.  
- **Day 7:** Stable off support, transitioned to step-down unit.

### Problem-Based Assessment and Plan

---

#### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock due to Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
   - **Assessment:** Severe LV systolic dysfunction, likely underlying nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Refractory shock requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP).
   - **Plan:**
     - LVAD support (Impella) placed, now explanted.
     - Daily echo assessments.
     - Continue GDMT (metoprolol, low-dose ACEi if tolerated).
     - Monitor for arrhythmias.
     - Cardiac MRI planned as outpatient.

#### 2. **Volume Overload / Renal Dysfunction**
   - **Assessment:** Oliguric AKI, likely cardiorenal syndrome. Improved with diuresis post-LVAD.
   - **Plan:**
     - IV furosemide.
     - Strict I/Os, daily weights.
     - Renal panel q12h.
     - Avoid nephrotoxins.

#### 3. **Chronic Pain / Opioid Dependence**
   - **Assessment:** Chronic opioid use for pain (migraine, dental, sinus). High risk for withdrawal.
   - **Plan:**
     - Continue home opioid regimen, titrate to effect.
     - Consult pain service.
     - Monitor for withdrawal, constipation.

#### 4. **Fever / Suspected Infection**
   - **Assessment:** Single fever, negative cultures, likely non-infectious.
   - **Plan:**
     - Monitor for new fevers, repeat cultures if indicated.
     - Abx discontinued.

#### 5. **Migraine Management**
   - **Assessment:** No acute migraine during ICU stay.
   - **Plan:**
     - Continue home regimen.
     - PRN antiemetics.

#### 6. **Chronic Sinusitis / Impacted Molars**
   - **Assessment:** Not contributing to current admission.
   - **Plan:**
     - Resume outpatient follow-up post-discharge.

#### 7. **Nutrition**
   - **Assessment:** Mildly malnourished, reduced po intake x 5d.
   - **Plan:**
     - High-calorie, high-protein diet.
     - Nutritionist consult.

#### 8. **DVT Prophylaxis**
   - **Plan:** SCDs, SQ heparin.

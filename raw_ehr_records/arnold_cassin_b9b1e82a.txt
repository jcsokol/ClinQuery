# HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Mr. Arnold Cassin is a 67-year-old man with a complex PMHx including hypertension, HLD, prediabetes, chronic anemia, and recent viral sinusitis, who presented to the ED with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and confusion. He was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with evidence of low cardiac output, hypotension, and rising lactate. Despite medical therapy, he developed worsening shock and was transferred to the Cardiac ICU for consideration of temporary mechanical circulatory support. On HD2, he required placement of an Impella CP percutaneous LV assist device for cardiogenic shock. His course was complicated by AKI, anemia requiring transfusion, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is currently weaning off the Impella and remains on low-dose inotropes.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Acute on Chronic HFrEF**
- **Assessment:**  
  Presented in extremis, BP 80/45, HR 116, cold extremities, elevated JVP. Echo: LVEF ~20%, globally reduced, moderate MR. Troponin I peaked at 0.28, downtrending. CXR: pulmonary edema. Swan: CI 1.6, wedge 27.
- **Interventions:**  
  - Initiated dobutamine, uptitrated to 7.5 mcg/kg/min  
  - Furosemide drip for volume overload  
  - Impella CP placed HD2 via R femoral artery  
  - Daily TTEs for LV function
  - Weaning off pressors, Impella flows down to P3
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue Impella wean, reassess for device explant in 24h  
  - Maintain MAP >65, adjust vasopressors as needed  
  - Serial lactates, mixed venous O2 sats  
  - Transition to oral HF regimen as tolerated (BB, ACEi/ARB, MRA, SGLT2i)

### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), Stage II**
- **Assessment:**  
  Baseline Cr 1.0, peaked at 2.2 on HD3. Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, diuretics, contrast load. UOP improved with hemodynamic recovery.
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor daily BMP, strict I/O  
  - Avoid nephrotoxins  
  - Nephrology following, no RRT indicated  
  - Reduce diuretic dose as tolerated

### 3. **Anemia (Chronic, Acute on Chronic)**
- **Assessment:**  
  Baseline Hgb ~10, dropped to 7.8 on HD4. r/o hemolysis (haptoglobin nl, LDH nl), no overt bleeding, likely dilutional and procedural.
- **Plan:**  
  - Transfused 1U PRBC HD4  
  - Monitor CBC q12h  
  - Iron studies pending, consider IV iron if ferritin <100

### 4. **Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia**
- **Assessment:**  
  Developed fever, new infiltrate, leukocytosis on HD5. Sputum cx growing MSSA.
- **Plan:**  
  - Cefazolin 2g IV q8h x7d  
  - Pulmonary toilet, IS, early mobilization  
  - Monitor for sepsis, repeat CXR prn

### 5. **Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Prediabetes**
- **Assessment:**  
  Home meds: HCTZ, simvastatin, A1c 5.8%. BP labile in ICU.
- **Plan:**  
  - Hold HCTZ while on pressors  
  - Resume statin  
  - Monitor glucose, no insulin needed  
  - Reassess outpatient for SGLT2i after HF stabilized

### 6. **History of Viral Sinusitis, Acute Bronchitis**
- **Assessment:**  
  No current symptoms. Completed course of abx pre-admission.
- **Plan:**  
  - No further abx needed  
  - Monitor for nosocomial infection

### 7. **Other: Prior Forearm Fracture**
- **Assessment:**  
  Healed, no current issues.
- **Plan:**  
  - None

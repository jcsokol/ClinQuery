# ADMISSION NOTE

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Acute onset dyspnea, chest tightness, and syncope at home.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Hayley Armstrong is a 29-year-old woman with a history of childhood asthma, recurrent bronchitis, and prior uncomplicated pregnancies who presented to the ED after a syncopal episode at home. She reported 2 days of progressive exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and mild pleuritic chest pain. No recent URI symptoms. On arrival, she was tachycardic, hypotensive (BP 78/52), tachypneic, and hypoxemic (SpO₂ 89% RA). She required 4L NC O₂ and was transferred to the ICU for escalating inotropic and respiratory support. Initial TTE showed severe global LV hypokinesis, LVEF 15%, and mild RV dysfunction. No significant valvulopathy. Cardiac enzymes were elevated. Infectious work-up was negative. She rapidly deteriorated with worsening shock and end-organ hypoperfusion, requiring emergent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Childhood asthma
- Acute bronchitis (multiple episodes)
- Cystitis
- Streptococcal pharyngitis (remote)
- Sprain of right ankle (remote)
- 3 prior normal pregnancies, no complications

## PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
- None

## OB/GYN
- G3P3, LMP: 2 weeks ago, regular cycles

## MEDICATIONS (on admission)

# ICU HOSPITAL COURSE (Days 1–7)

## Day 1
- Admitted in cardiogenic shock, requiring norepinephrine and dobutamine
- Impella CP placed at bedside for LV support
- Broad-spectrum abx started (concern for myocarditis vs sepsis)
- Initial labs: lactic acidosis, AKI, elevated troponin, mild transaminitis

## Day 2  
- Hemodynamics improved with Impella + pressors, urine output increased
- Echo: LVEF 18%, Impella flow 3.4 L/min
- Infectious workup negative, stopped abx
- Diuresis started

## Day 3–4  
- Gradual wean of vasopressors
- Mental status improved, extubated on Day 4
- Serial TTE: LVEF up to 28%, Impella support ongoing
- Mild improvement in renal/liver function

## Day 5–7  
- Impella weaned, removed on Day 7 after echo showed LVEF 38%
- Transitioned to oral HF meds (metoprolol, sacubitril/valsartan)
- Mobilizing with PT, tolerating oral diet
- Awaiting cardiac MRI

# ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Severe Systolic HF (new, likely myocarditis vs. idiopathic)**
   - Required emergent Impella CP for LV support due to refractory shock
   - Successfully weaned off after 7 days, LVEF now 38%
   - Plan: Continue GDMT (metoprolol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone), monitor for arrhythmias, cardiac MRI pending

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**
   - Likely secondary to hypoperfusion, now improving
   - Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins

**3. Transaminitis (improving)**
   - Likely ischemic hepatitis from shock
   - LFTs trending down, monitor

**4. Fever on admission**
   - Infectious workup negative, likely inflammatory
   - No abx needed at this time

**5. Asthma (mild, remote)**
   - No current exacerbation
   - Continue inhalers PRN

**6. VTE Prophylaxis**
   - On SQ heparin

**7. Nutrition**
   - On cardiac diet, PO intake adequate

**8. Physical Therapy**
   - Mobilizing, continue daily PT/OT

**9. Psychosocial**
   - Supportive counseling provided, social work consult

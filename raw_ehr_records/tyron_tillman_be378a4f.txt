**EPIC EHR - INPATIENT PROGRESS NOTE**  
**Patient:** Tyron Tillman  
**MRN:** 00238817  
**Date of Birth:** 12/18/1932  
**Sex:** Male  
**Date of Admission:** 06/01/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. John Franks  
**Consults:** Cardiology, Nephrology, Endocrinology, Urology  
**Location:** ICU 2B, Room 14

---

**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**  
Altered mental status, chest pain, and shortness of breath.

---

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  
Mr. Tyron Tillman is a 91-year-old male with an extensive past medical history including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 with neuropathy and diabetic nephropathy (CKD stage 3b), coronary artery disease, prior MI, hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic syndrome, prostate neoplasm, and chronic alcohol and tobacco use. He presented to the ED from home after his wife found him confused and complaining of chest pain and dyspnea. He was tachypneic, hypotensive (BP 82/54), and hypoxic on arrival. Initial ECG showed ST elevations in the anterior leads and troponin was elevated. He was taken emergently to the cath lab where he was found to have a 100% proximal LAD occlusion and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of a drug-eluting stent. Due to persistent hypotension and evidence of cardiogenic shock (cold extremities, rising creatinine, confusion), an Impella CP device (temporary LVAD) was placed for hemodynamic support. He was transferred to the ICU for further management.

# ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**91M with CAD, DM2, CKD, s/p STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring temporary LVAD (Impella), now improving.**

---

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute MI / Heart Failure**
   - s/p PCI (LAD stent), Impella CP placed for shock, now explanted.
   - Remains on dual antiplatelet (ASA, clopidogrel) and high-intensity statin.
   - Continue GDMT for HF (ACEi, BB, diuretic as tolerated).
   - Monitor for arrhythmia, recurrent ischemia.
   - Cardiology following.

**2. Chronic Kidney Disease / Acute Kidney Injury**
   - Baseline CKD, now with AKI (Cr peaked at 4.5, trending down).
   - Strict I/O, daily weights.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds.
   - Nephrology following.

**3. Diabetes Mellitus / Metabolic Syndrome**
   - Continue insulin, monitor glucose q6h.
   - Hold metformin, other nephrotoxic agents.
   - Monitor for DKA/HHS.

**4. Prostate Neoplasm**
   - Continue leuprolide, docetaxel as outpatient.
   - PSA stable.
   - Urology to follow up.

**5. Alcohol Use Disorder / Tobacco Use**
   - CIWA protocol, thiamine, folate.

**7. Secondary Prevention**
   - Statins, antiplatelet, ACEi, beta-blocker.
   - Cardiac rehab referral at discharge.

**8. Disposition**
   - Transfer to telemetry, then consider SNF vs home with home health.

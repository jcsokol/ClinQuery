### ICU COURSE SUMMARY

**Day 0 (Admission):**  
- Arrived in cardiogenic shock, MAP 52 mmHg, HR 137, RR 28, SpO2 90% RA.  
- Intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.  
- Initiated on norepinephrine and dobutamine.  
- Echo: severe global hypokinesis, EF 18%, LV dilated, RV mod. impaired.  
- Emergent LHC: no obstructive CAD, elevated LVEDP.  
- Placed Impella CP (percutaneous LVAD) for hemodynamic support.  
- Labs: Mixed lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury, transaminitis.  
- Transferred to CICU.

**Day 1:**  
- On Impella support, pressors titrated down.  
- Renal function worsening, started furosemide drip for diuresis.  
- CXR: pulmonary edema improved.  
- Troponin trended down.  
- Developed mild thrombocytopenia.

**Day 2:**  
- MAPs stable >65, weaning off norepinephrine.  
- Neuro exam: mild confusion, resolving.  
- Impella flows 3.2 L/min.  
- Started on low-dose beta blocker.  
- Diuresis ongoing, urine output adequate.

**Day 3:**  
- Impella wean trial tolerated.  
- Off all pressors.  
- Extubated to high-flow nasal cannula.  
- Labs: Creatinine improving, LFTs downtrending.  
- Plan for Impella removal if stable overnight.

**Day 4:**  
- Impella removed, hemodynamics stable.  
- Transitioned to oral heart failure regimen.  
- Transferred to step-down telemetry unit.

### PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock due to Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (new-onset, nonischemic CMP)**
- Impella CP placed on admission for hemodynamic support, successfully weaned.
- Continue GDMT for heart failure: carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone, furosemide.
- Daily weights, strict I/Os, monitor for recurrent decompensation.
- Cardiology f/u, consider genetic CMP panel.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (likely pre-renal, secondary to low perfusion)**
- Improved with restoration of cardiac output.
- Monitor BMP, urine output.
- Avoid nephrotoxins, continue gentle diuresis.

**3. Hepatic Congestion/Transaminitis**
- Likely secondary to shock liver.
- LFTs trending down; monitor q48h.

**4. Obesity (BMI 30)**
- Nutritional consult.
- Encourage weight loss post-discharge.

**5. Hypertension**
- Resume antihypertensives as tolerated.
- Home HCTZ on hold; will reassess on discharge.

**6. Contraception Management**
- Continue Mirena IUD and etonogestrel implant in situ.
- No acute issues with current regimens.

**7. Thrombocytopenia (mild)**
- Likely multifactorial (device, hemodilution, sepsis).
- Monitor platelets daily.

**8. Psychosocial/Discharge Planning**
- Social work consult for home support.
- Education on CHF, device history, medication adherence.

### Chief Complaint
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and fatigue.  

---

### History of Present Illness
Damion Thiel is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obesity (BMI ~29-30), prediabetes, chronic anemia, and recent acute viral pharyngitis. He presented via EMS after 4 days of worsening dyspnea, PND, and bilateral leg swelling. He described mild chest tightness but denied typical angina. He had subjective fevers and sore throat a week prior, with decreased oral intake. On arrival, he was tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic, prompting ICU transfer for acute decompensated heart failure with evidence of cardiogenic shock.  

During ICU stay, he developed escalating vasopressor requirements and deteriorating end-organ perfusion. After multidisciplinary discussion, a decision was made to place a percutaneous temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

## Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
- Likely precipitated by viral myocarditis on background of HTN, obesity.
- Required pressors, inotropes, and temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP).
- **Plan:** Continue GDMT for HF, monitor for arrhythmias, continue telemetry, daily weights, strict I/Os. Cardiology to follow.

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)
- Pre-renal etiology from hypoperfusion, improved with support.
- **Plan:** Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, continue diuresis as tolerated.

### 3. Chronic Anemia
- Baseline Hgb ~11 g/dL, nadir 9.7 g/dL during ICU course.
- **Plan:** Monitor CBC, iron studies outpatient, no transfusion indicated at present.

### 4. Prediabetes
- A1c 6.1%, stress hyperglycemia noted, no DKA/HHS.
- **Plan:** Monitor glucose, continue lifestyle mod, consider metformin outpatient.

### 5. Hypertension
- Previously controlled, labile during ICU stay.
- **Plan:** Resume home meds, monitor BP, titrate as tolerated.

### 6. Obesity (BMI 29-30)
- Risk factor for HF, OSA.
- **Plan:** Nutrition consult, encourage weight loss, f/u outpatient.

### 7. Recent Viral Pharyngitis
- Resolved, no ongoing symptoms.
- **Plan:** Supportive.

### 8. Electrolyte Abnormalities
- Mild hypokalemia on days 2-3, now resolved.
- **Plan:** Monitor chemistries, replete PRN.

### 9. ICU Delirium/Weakness
- Mild, improved with reorientation, early PT/OT.
- **Plan:** Continue mobility, minimize sedation.

---

**Disposition:**  
Stable for transfer to step-down/telemetry. Plan for aggressive GDMT titration, cardiac rehab referral, close outpatient follow-up.

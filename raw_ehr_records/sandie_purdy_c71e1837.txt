Shortness of breath, chest pain, and confusion.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sandie Purdy is an 91-year-old female with a complex PMHx including type 2 diabetes, CKD stage 1, breast cancer (s/p L mastectomy 2009), hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, anemia, and osteoarthritis, who presented with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest discomfort. She was found by family to be confused and diaphoretic at home, with a home blood glucose of 278 mg/dL.

EMS noted hypoxia (O2 sat 86% RA), tachycardia (HR 126), and hypotension (SBP 82). En route to ED, she developed pulseless VT requiring CPR x3 min, ROSC achieved. In ED, ECG showed ST depressions V2-V5, TnI 13.1 ng/mL, BNP 1620 pg/mL. CXR: pulmonary edema. Emergent echo: severe global LV dysfunction (EF 20%), mild RV dysfunction, moderate MR. She was intubated for hypoxic resp failure and admitted to MICU for cardiogenic shock.

Due to persistent hypotension despite norepi and dobutamine, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed. She was anticoagulated with heparin. Over the subsequent days, she developed AKI and mild transaminitis.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

91F w/ DM2, CKD, HLD, breast CA hx, anemia, who presented s/p cardiac arrest, found to be in cardiogenic shock 2/2 acute decompensated HF w/ severe LV dysfunction (likely ischemic). Required temporary LVAD (Impella) for hemodynamic support.

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (s/p cardiac arrest, severe LV dysfunction, Impella)**
   - Impella placed day 1 for refractory shock, now removed after hemodynamic recovery
   - Continue close hemodynamic monitoring
   - Titrate off pressors as tolerated
   - Serial echocardiography for recovery
   - Cardiology f/u for consideration of long-term advanced HF therapies

**2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
   - Diuresis as tolerated (now off IV diuretics, UOP improving)
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os
   - Monitor for recurrent congestion

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (on CKD)**
   - Likely ischemic/ATN, Cr improving
   - Renal consult: continue to avoid nephrotoxins, monitor UOP/lytes
   - Hold ACEi/ARB, adjust meds as needed

**4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**
   - Sliding scale insulin in ICU
   - Resume home regimen when eating, monitor BGs q6h

**5. Anemia (chronic, multifactorial)**
   - Hgb stable, no transfusion needed
   - Monitor CBC

**6. Fever/possible Sepsis**
   - Febrile on day 3, empiric abx started (now off, cultures neg)
   - Monitor for secondary infection

**7. Hyperlipidemia / Hypertriglyceridemia / Metabolic Syndrome**
   - Continue statin, dietary counseling

**8. History of Breast Cancer**
   - s/p mastectomy, no evidence recurrence

**9. Osteoarthritis, chronic pain**
   - Resume naproxen as tolerated, pain control

**10. Delirium**
    - Likely multifactorial (ICU, metabolic), improving
    - Re-orient, minimize sedation

**11. Disposition**
    - Continue ICU monitoring x24h, anticipate transfer to stepdown pending stability
    - PT/OT consult for mobility, d/c planning

---

### ORDERS/TO DO
- TTE repeat in 3d
- Daily CBC, chem7, Mg/Phos
- Monitor UOP, I/O q2h
- Insulin sliding scale
- DVT ppx
- SCDs
- Foley to gravity, assess for removal
- Family meeting for goals of care

#### (Page 4/4)

**PHYSICAL THERAPY INITIAL ASSESSMENT**
- Patient awake, weak but able to move all extremities.
- Will require rehab post-ICU for deconditioning.
- Recommend early mobilization as tolerated.

---

**Additional Labs:**  
- Mg: 1.7 → 2.1 mg/dL

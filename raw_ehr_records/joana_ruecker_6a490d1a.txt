## Admission H&P (5/21/2024)

**Chief Complaint:**  
Shortness of breath, chest pressure, and near-syncope

**History of Present Illness:**  
Joana Ruecker is a 29-year-old female with PMH notable for recurrent viral sinusitis, viral pharyngitis, and recent whiplash injury, who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and pleuritic chest pain. She reports a flu-like syndrome 1 week ago, followed by progressive fatigue. On the day of presentation, she developed near-syncope while climbing stairs. In the ED, she was found to be hypotensive (SBP 83 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 122), and hypoxic (SpO2 89% on RA). Exam notable for elevated JVP, diffuse rales, and cool extremities.

**Pertinent PMH:**  
- Viral sinusitis, recurrent  
- Acute viral pharyngitis, recurrent  
- Whiplash injury (remote, no neuro deficits)  
- No known cardiac disease prior to this admission

**Medications on Admission:**  
- Amoxicillin/clavulanate 250/125 mg PO BID (recent, for sinusitis)  
- Yaz, Natazia, Jolivette, Trinessa (all OCPs—patient unclear which, stopped at admission)  
- Ibuprofen 200 mg PO PRN

**Allergies:**  
No known drug allergies

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker  
- No EtOH, illicit drugs  
- Lives with partner, no children

**Family History:**  
- Negative for early cardiac disease, SCD, or known inherited disorders

## Hospital Course Summary

**Day 1:**  
Admitted to MICU for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and shock. Initial workup revealed elevated troponin (see labs), BNP 1,242 pg/mL. TTE: severely depressed LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis. Cardiology/CCU consulted—concern for acute viral myocarditis with cardiogenic shock. Started norepinephrine, furosemide, empiric antibiotics. Intubated for worsening hypoxia.

**Day 2:**  
Hemodynamics worsening despite escalating pressors/inotropes. Multidisciplinary decision for temporary LV support—Impella CP placed via femoral approach in cath lab. Immediate improvement in MAP and urine output. Repeat TTE: Impella position satisfactory.

**Day 3–5:**  
Ongoing Impella support. Gradual diuresis, improvement in end-organ function. Developed mild transaminitis (see labs), likely congestive hepatopathy. Neurologically intact when sedatives weaned. Extubated on Day 5.

**Day 6–8:**  
Hemodynamics stable. Impella weaned and explanted on Day 7. Started low-dose carvedilol, lisinopril. Persistent fatigue, but no recurrent chest pain or SOB. Mobilizing with PT.

**Day 9:**  
Transferred to step-down telemetry. Echo: LVEF improved to 36%. Plan for outpatient cardiac MRI, viral panel, and close HF follow-up.

## Assessment & Plan (Written 2024-05-29, Dr. S. Patel)

### 1. **Acute Myocarditis with Cardiogenic Shock**
- Likely viral (recent URI, no ischemic risk factors, diffuse TTE findings).
- Required temporary LV support (Impella CP, Days 2–7).
- Now hemodynamically stable, off pressors/inotropes.
- **Plan:** Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF, cardiac MRI as outpatient, viral panel pending.

### 2. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
- LVEF improved from 15% to 36%.
- Diuresed 8L net negative.
- **Plan:** Monitor volume status, continue low-dose loop diuretic, titrate beta-blocker and ACEi.

### 3. **Temporary Mechanical Circulatory Support**
- Impella CP placed Day 2, explanted Day 7. No vascular complications.
- **Plan:** Site care, monitor for delayed hematoma/pseudoaneurysm.

### 4. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
- Intubated Day 1, extubated Day 5.
- **Plan:** Incentive spirometry, pulmonary rehab as tolerated.

### 5. **Transaminitis**
- Mild AST/ALT elevation, peaked Day 3, trending down.
- No evidence of intrinsic liver disease.
- **Plan:** Monitor LFTs, supportive care.

### 6. **Recent Viral Syndrome**
- Respiratory viral panel pending.
- **Plan:** Supportive, infection control precautions discontinued.

### 7. **History of Sinusitis/Pharyngitis**
- Completing recent amox/clav course.
- **Plan:** No further antibiotics.

### 8. **Whiplash Injury (remote)**
- No neuro symptoms.
- **Plan:** No action needed.

### 9. **Contraceptive Use**
- OCPs held during admission.
- **Plan:** Discuss safe options at discharge.

### 10. **Mild Anemia**
- Hgb nadir 10.8, likely dilutional.
- **Plan:** Monitor, no transfusion needed.

### 11. **Mild AKI**
- Creatinine peaked 1.6, now 0.9.
- **Plan:** Continue to monitor, avoid nephrotoxins.

Sex: Female  
Date of Admission: 2024-05-18

Attending: Dr. Julie McNair  
Consultants: Cardiology, Nephrology, Pain Management, Dentistry  
Location: MICU

**Chief Complaint:**  
Acute decompensated heart failure requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support.

---

**HPI:**  
Alene Lubowitz is a 46-year-old obese female with a complex medical history including chronic intractable migraine, chronic pain, anemia, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and recent drug overdose, who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest heaviness. She was found to be hypoxic (SpO2 87% RA), tachycardic, and hypotensive (BP 82/53). She had progressive confusion and anuria on arrival. Her exam was notable for JVD, rales, S3, and cool extremities. She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Initial labs revealed acute kidney injury, elevated troponin, and lactic acidosis. Echo showed severely reduced LV function (EF 18%), moderate RV dysfunction, and global hypokinesis. Cardiology recommended placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP). She was transferred to the ICU for advanced heart failure management.

**Significant Hospital Events:**

- **Day 1:** Admitted to ICU, intubated, started on norepinephrine, dobutamine, lasix. Impella CP placed via right femoral artery.  
- **Day 2:** Remained hemodynamically tenuous. Developed oliguric renal failure. Started on CVVH.  
- **Day 3:** Gradual improvement in perfusion. Weaned norepinephrine.  
- **Day 4:** Extubated, mentation improved. Impella weaned to P2.  
- **Day 5:** Impella removed. Transitioned to oral diuretics, uptitrated GDMT.  
- **Day 6:** Transferred to stepdown.

**Problem-Based Assessment & Plan**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to acute decompensated heart failure**
   - Etiology likely ischemic vs. toxic/metabolic (h/o overdose).
   - Impella CP placed for temporary circulatory support.
   - Vasopressors (norepinephrine), inotropes (dobutamine) used.
   - Serial TTEs: LV function improved to EF 30% by day 5.
   - Plan: Continue aggressive diuresis, start beta-blocker/ACEi as tolerated, monitor for arrhythmias, daily weights.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO III)**
   - Likely multifactorial: low perfusion, nephrotoxic insult (possible NSAID abuse).
   - Oliguric, required CRRT x 48h; now improved, off CRRT.
   - Plan: Renal dosing of all medications, nephrology f/u, daily BMP.

**3. Chronic pain syndrome / migraines**
   - Home regimen on hold; acetaminophen prn, avoid NSAIDs.
   - Pain consult: started on gabapentin, non-pharm modalities.
   - Plan: Resume migraine prophylaxis after stabilization.

**4. Anemia**
   - Baseline chronic anemia, Hgb dropped to 7.2 on day 2 (likely hemodilution, critical illness).
   - 1 unit PRBC transfused on day 3.
   - Monitor CBC daily, iron panel pending.

**5. Hyperlipidemia**
   - Simvastatin resumed after transaminases normalized.
   - Plan: Outpatient lipid clinic referral.

**6. Obesity (BMI 30)**
   - Monitored for OSA, DVT prophylaxis with heparin.
   - Dietician consult.

**7. Impaired dentition / impacted molars**
   - Not addressed during ICU stay; will defer to outpatient.

**8. Drug overdose (remote)**
   - No acute toxicity on admission tox screen.
   - Social work, psych consult.

**9. Recent pregnancy/miscarriage history**
   - Not relevant to current admission.

**10. Acute bronchitis/viral pharyngitis (h/o)**
   - No evidence of active infection.

---

**Physical Exam (Day 5, post-extubation):**  
- **Gen:** Awake, NAD  
- **HEENT:** Poor dentition, oral mucosa moist  
- **CV:** Irreg rhythm, S3, no murmurs post-Impella  
- **Lungs:** Bibasilar crackles improved  
- **Abd:** Soft, NT, no HSM  
- **Ext:** 1+ pitting edema, no DVT  
- **Neuro:** AAOx3, CN grossly intact  
- **Skin:** No breakdown

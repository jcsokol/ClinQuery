### Admission H&P

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.

**History of Present Illness:**  
37-year-old male with no significant cardiac history presented to the ED with a 1-week history of worsening dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and fatigue. He also reports a recent URI (viral sinusitis treated with amox/clav) and a minor laceration of his right foot (healing, no signs of infection). No chest pain but does endorse palpitations. On arrival, he was found to be hypotensive (SBP 80s), tachycardic, and hypoxic (Sat 89% on RA). Rapidly progressed to cardiogenic shock, requiring vasopressors and subsequent placement of a temporary left-sided heart pump (Impella CP) for circulatory support.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Viral sinusitis (recent)  
- Laceration, right foot (recent, superficial, healing)  
- No known prior cardiac history  
- No DM, HTN, CKD, or dyslipidemia previously documented

**Past Surgical History:**  
- None

**Medications on Admission:**  
- Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 250/125 mg PO BID (for sinusitis)  
- Acetaminophen 325 mg PO PRN

**Allergies:**  
- NKDA

**Social History:**  
- No tobacco, EtOH only socially, no illicit drug use  
- Lives with wife and two children  
- Works as a software engineer

**Family History:**  
- Father: MI at 54, alive  
- Mother: HTN, alive

**Review of Systems:**  
- Positive: Dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, mild cough  
- Negative: Chest pain, fevers, chills, hemoptysis, GI symptoms

### Physical Exam

**GEN:** Alert, oriented, appears fatigued  
**VS:** BP 84/52 (MAP 63), HR 112, RR 24, T 36.8, SpO2 91% on 4L NC  
**HEENT:** Oropharynx clear, mild sinus congestion  
**CV:** Tachycardic, S3 present, no murmurs/gallops/rubs, JVP 12 cm  
**RESP:** Tachypneic, bibasilar crackles  
**ABD:** Soft, NT, no HSM  
**EXT:** 1+ pitting edema bilateral LE, right foot with healing 2cm superficial laceration  
**NEURO:** AOx3, no focal deficits

### Hospital Course (ICU Days 1-8)

**Day 1 (Admission):**

### Assessment & Plan

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, new-onset severe LV systolic dysfunction**  
- Likely viral myocarditis (recent URI) vs. idiopathic DCM  
- Required Impella CP for circulatory support; now explanted  
- Cardiac function improving but EF remains reduced  
- Plan: Continue GDMT (metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone), cardiac rehab, serial Echos, outpatient HF follow-up

**2. Acute Kidney Injury, resolving**  
- Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, diuresis  
- Now improving, monitor daily renal panel  
- Avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds as needed

**3. Volume Overload / Heart Failure Exacerbation**  
- Managed with diuresis, now euvolemic  
- Daily weights, strict I/O, sodium restriction

**4. Foot Laceration, right (recent, healing)**  
- No signs of infection  
- Continue local wound care, monitor for cellulitis

**5. Transaminitis, mild (AST/ALT peaked at 52/53)**  
- Likely ischemic hepatitis from low-flow state  
- Downtrending, monitor LFTs

**6. Deconditioning**  
- Physical therapy started  
- Encourage early mobility, DVT prophylaxis

**7. Pain, mild (post-laceration, post-procedure)**  
- Acetaminophen PRN  
- Pain scores low, no opioids needed

**8. Hyperglycemia (transient, stress-related)**  
- Now resolved  
- Monitor glucose qAM

**9. Risk of Arrhythmia**  
- Telemetry monitoring  
- No sustained VT/VF; continue to monitor

---

**Discharge Planning:**  
- Anticipate transfer to stepdown unit within 24h  
- Arrange for outpatient cardiology follow-up  
- Patient education: HF, wound care, medication compliance  
- Social work consult for home support

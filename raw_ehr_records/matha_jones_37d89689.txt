Shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Matha Jones is a 53-year-old female with a PMH notable for chronic hypertension, prediabetes, anemia, and a remote history of preeclampsia, who presented to the ED with 2 days of progressive dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, and intermittent chest pain. On arrival, she was noted to be tachycardic, hypertensive, and hypoxic. Initial troponin was elevated at 2.3 ng/mL. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Echo revealed severe global LV hypokinesis (EF 18%), and she rapidly decompensated into cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressors and intubation. Due to refractory shock, an Impella CP device was placed for temporary mechanical circulatory support.

- Impella CP placed, now removed; close monitoring for access complications  
- Vasopressors discontinued, hemodynamics stable  
- Diuresis ongoing; fluid balance net negative  
- Continue low-dose BB, titrate as tolerated  
- Daily weights, strict I/Os  
- Cardiology to follow

**2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**  
- Initially intubated, now extubated to high-flow NC  
- Wean O2, monitor ABG  
- Incentive spirometry, pulmonary hygiene

**3. Hypertension (chronic, poorly controlled)**  
- Restart home HCTZ when euvolemic  
- Add ACE-I if renal function stable  
- Monitor BP q4h

**4. Anemia (chronic, iron deficiency)**  
- Hgb trending down with diuresis  
- IV iron started  
- Monitor CBC qAM  
- Consider transfusion if symptomatic or Hgb<8

**5. Prediabetes**  
- Monitor glucoses, sliding scale insulin as needed  
- Plan: outpatient DM education, A1c recheck in 3 months

**6. Transaminitis (mild, likely shock liver)**  
- Trend LFTs  
- No hepatotoxic meds

**7. VTE Prophylaxis**  
- Heparin SQ

- Monitor electrolytes, replete K/Mg as needed

**9. Disposition/Functional Status**

- Discuss alternatives prior to discharge

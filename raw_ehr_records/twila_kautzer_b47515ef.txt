# ICU Admission Note

## Chief Complaint
Shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest tightness for 3 days.

## HPI
39-year-old female with a history of obesity, recurrent acute bronchitis, prior miscarriage, and normal pregnancy, presented with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. She developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension in the ED. Initial ECG showed sinus tachycardia with low voltage; troponin mildly elevated. Echo revealed severe global LV systolic dysfunction (EF ~15%), mild RV dysfunction, and moderate MR. She was admitted to the MICU for management of presumed acute decompensated heart failure, later developed cardiogenic shock refractory to medical therapy, requiring placement of a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2.

- Admitted with acute decompensated HF, escalating O2 requirements, started on IV loop diuretic, nitroglycerin drip, and low-dose norepinephrine for hypotension.  
- Labs notable for elevated BNP, mild troponin elevation, AKI (Cr 1.7 from baseline 0.9), mild transaminitis.

**Day 2:**

# Problem-Based Assessment and Plan

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure)**
   - *Assessment*: Severe LV dysfunction, rapid onset shock, likely non-ischemic.  
   - *Plan*:  
     - Temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for circulatory support (placed day 2, removed day 5).  
     - Diuresis with IV furosemide; titrated as renal function improved.  
     - Vasopressors weaned post-LVAD.  
     - Serial TTEs to monitor recovery.  
     - Cardiac MRI pending as outpatient for etiology (myocarditis vs. idiopathic DCM).  
     - GDMT for HF to be initiated as tolerated.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**
   - *Assessment*: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion, prerenal.  
   - *Plan*:  
     - Monitored UOP, daily BMP.  
     - Avoided nephrotoxins.  
     - Renal function normalized by day 4.

**3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation**
   - *Assessment*: Occurred during ICU course, likely related to stress/catecholamines.  
   - *Plan*:  
     - Rate control with metoprolol.  
     - Anticoagulation not indicated (CHA2DS2-VASc = 1).  
     - Monitor for recurrence.

**4. Obesity (BMI 30.5)**
   - *Assessment*: Risk factor for HF, OSA.  
   - *Plan*:  
     - Dietician consult.  
     - Daily weights, fluid restriction.  
     - Counsel on weight loss post-discharge.

**5. Contraception Management**
   - *Assessment*: On multiple hormonal agents.  
   - *Plan*:  
     - OBGYN consult.  
     - Discussed risks/benefits of estrogen-containing contraceptives in context of new HF.

**6. History of Bronchitis**
   - *Assessment*: No active infection on this admission; negative respiratory viral panel.  
   - *Plan*:  
     - Supportive care, incentive spirometry.

**7. Psychosocial/Functional**
   - *Assessment*: Anxiety re: new diagnosis, young children at home.  
   - *Plan*:  
     - Social work consult, family meeting.  
     - PT/OT to assess for safe discharge.

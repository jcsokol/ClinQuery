# HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Mr. Vernon Kuphal is a 106-year-old male with a complex past medical history including **non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, stage 1), prostate neoplasm (s/p leuprolide), chronic anemia, prediabetes, history of alcoholism, acute cholecystitis (s/p cholecystostomy), and multiple episodes of viral sinusitis**, who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and shock. During his admission, he developed acute decompensated heart failure complicated by cardiogenic shock, requiring Impella CP placement for circulatory support in the ICU.

---

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock / Heart Failure

**Assessment:**  
On hospital day 2, patient developed acute hypotension (SBP 70s mmHg), cool extremities, and worsening lactic acidosis. Echo revealed severe global LV hypokinesis, EF ~20%. Troponin I uptrending (see labs). Despite maximal vasopressor/inotrope support (norepinephrine, dobutamine), he remained in refractory shock. Cardiology consulted; Impella CP placed at bedside on 5/3 for temporary mechanical circulatory support.

**Plan:**  
- Continue Impella CP support; daily device checks  
- Titrate inotropes/vasopressors to MAP >65  
- Strict I/Os, daily weights  
- Serial EKGs, telemetry  
- Daily TTE  
- Wean support as tolerated  
- Goal-directed therapy (MAP, lactate, UOP)  
- DVT ppx: heparin 5000U SQ BID (bleeding risk discussed)  
- Cardiology to follow daily

---

## 2. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage 1) with Suspected Progression

**Assessment:**  
Admitted with cough, hemoptysis, and left upper lobe mass on CT. Oncology following. Biopsy pending. Recent chemo (docetaxel, cisplatin, paclitaxel) given last month.  
**Plan:**  
- Hold chemotherapy during acute critical illness  
- Oncology to reassess after stabilization  
- Palliative care consult for goals of care

---

## 3. Acute Cholecystitis/Cholelithiasis

**Assessment:**  
RUQ pain, positive Murphy’s, elevated LFTs (see labs). US: distended GB with stones, no ductal dilation. Mildly elevated WBC.  
**Plan:**  
- Piperacillin-tazobactam IV  
- NPO, IVF  
- Surgery: non-operative candidate (hemodynamic instability)  
- IR: percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placed day 4  
- Monitor for sepsis

---

## 4. Anemia

**Assessment:**  
Baseline chronic anemia (Hgb 8-10); now Hgb downtrending to 7.5. Multifactorial: chronic disease, chemo, acute illness.  
**Plan:**

- Monitor retic, iron studies  
- GI prophylaxis: pantoprazole IV  
- Hematology consult

---

## 5. Acute on Chronic Renal Injury

**Assessment:**  
Cr rose from baseline 0.9 to 1.6 mg/dL post contrast/pressors, with oliguria.  
**Plan:**

- Avoid nephrotoxins  
- Renal dose adjust all meds  
- Nephrology consult if worsening

## ADMISSION SUMMARY

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, lower extremity edema.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Deane Mohr is a 45-year-old female with a history of class II obesity (BMI ~30), prior miscarriage, recurrent UTIs (most recently E. coli), and prior ankle sprain, presenting with 1 week of progressive dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and increasing bilateral leg swelling. She initially presented to the ED with hypoxia (SpO2 88% RA), tachycardia (HR 122), and hypotension (BP 88/54). She was found to have an elevated BNP, troponin, and chest X-ray concerning for pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. She rapidly decompensated requiring ICU transfer for escalating inotropes and vasopressors. Given persistent shock, she underwent placement of a temporary left-sided percutaneous ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Obesity (BMI ~30)  
- Normal pregnancy (G2P1A1)  
- 1st trimester miscarriage  
- Recurrent UTIs (last: E. coli, 2023)  
- Ankle sprain (remote)  
- Fetus w/ unknown complication (remote, unclear details)  
- Viral pharyngitis (multiple episodes)

**Medications on Admission:**  
- Medroxyprogesterone acetate 150mg/mL IM q3mo  
- Nitrofurantoin 5mg/mL PO (prn for UTI)  
- Phenazopyridine 100mg PO (prn)  
- Ethinyl estradiol/norelgestromin patch  
- Acetaminophen 325mg PO prn  
- Camila, Errin, Jolivette (all norethindrone 0.35mg OCPs, previously used)

**Allergies:**  
NKDA

**Social History:**  
Lives with partner. No tobacco/alcohol/illicit drugs. Employed as a teacher.

**Family History:**  
Mother - HTN, DM2. Father - MI at 62.

## HOSPITAL COURSE

### ICU Day 1 (4/3/24):
- Admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension.  
- Initial labs: leukocytosis, mild anemia, elevated creatinine, BNP 3220, troponin 0.18, lactate 2.9.  
- Started on oxygen, IV furosemide, dobutamine drip, and norepinephrine.  
- Echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR, dilated LV.  
- CXR: Pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly.  
- Foley placed, strict I/Os.  
- Infectious work-up negative (COVID, influenza, blood/urine cx).

### ICU Day 2:
- Worsening shock, escalating vasopressors.  
- Multidisciplinary HF and cardiology consult.  
- Temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placed via right femoral artery.  
- Hemodynamics improved post-procedure.  
- Started on heparin drip for device.

### ICU Days 3-6:
- Gradual improvement in perfusion, weaning of vasopressors.  
- Diuresis continued, net negative 4L by day 5.  
- Renal function improved.  
- Some hemolysis noted (haptoglobin 18, LDH 680), no overt device malfunction.  
- Serial troponins trended down.  
- Device weaned and explanted on day 6.  
- Transitioned to oral HF meds (carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone).

### Floor Days 7-10:
- Stable, ambulating with PT/OT.  
- No further arrhythmias.  
- Discharge planning with close HF follow-up.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock (Acute Decompensated HFrEF)
**Assessment:**  
Severe new-onset HFrEF (EF 15%) likely non-ischemic, presenting with cardiogenic shock requiring temporary LVAD (Impella CP). Etiology unclear; no prior cardiac hx.  
**Plan:**  
- Continue guideline-directed HF therapy (carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone)  
- Monitor for volume overload, renal function  
- Echo prior to discharge  
- Cardiac MRI as outpatient to evaluate etiology  
- Close HF/Cardiology f/u

### 2. Temporary Left-Sided Heart Pump (Impella CP)
**Assessment:**  
Placed for refractory shock, removed after 4 days. Some hemolysis observed, no device-related complications.  
**Plan:**  
- Monitor Hb/Hct  
- Daily LDH/haptoglobin until stable  
- DVT ppx post-device

### 3. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, resolved)
**Assessment:**  
AKI on admission (Cr 1.8, baseline 0.9) due to hypoperfusion, improved with volume/CO restoration.  
**Plan:**  
- Monitor daily BMP  
- Avoid nephrotoxins

### 4. Obesity (BMI 30+)
**Assessment:**  
Obesity, risk factor for HF.  
**Plan:**  
- Nutrition consult  
- Encourage weight loss, activity as tolerated

### 5. Gynecologic Hx (G2P1A1, prior miscarriage, contraception)
**Assessment:**  
No acute gynecologic issues, continues hormonal contraception for menorrhagia.  
**Plan:**  
- Continue current regimen  
- Gyn f/u as outpatient

### 6. Recurrent UTIs (remote)
**Assessment:**  
No current symptoms.  
**Plan:**  
- Monitor for signs of infection  
- Foley removed as soon as possible

### 7. Anemia (mild, multifactorial)
**Assessment:**  
Likely due to hemodilution, possible hemolysis from device.  
**Plan:**  
- Monitor CBC  
- Iron studies as outpatient

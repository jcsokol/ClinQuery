### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Isidro Carroll is a 49-year-old male with a history of hypertension, prediabetes, anemia, and osteoarthritis of the hip who presented to the ED with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, and lower extremity swelling. He was initially found to be hypotensive (BP 86/54), tachycardic (HR 122), and hypoxic on room air (SpO2 88%). Exam notable for JVD, S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.

Initial workup revealed elevated troponin, BNP, and evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR. Echo in ED showed severely reduced LVEF (~15%) with global hypokinesis. He rapidly deteriorated with worsening shock, requiring norepinephrine and dobutamine infusions, and was transferred to the MICU. Due to refractory cardiogenic shock, a left-sided percutaneous temporary ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 1.

## ICU HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**Day 1:**  
Admission for acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock. Started on vasopressors/inotropes. Left-sided Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support. Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Central line, arterial line placed. Started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible sepsis (later negative).  

**Day 2:**  
Hemodynamics improved slightly, weaned norepinephrine. Remained oliguric. Lactate downtrend. Serial troponins peaked at 2.3 ng/mL. Developed mild transaminitis.  

**Day 3:**  
Impella continued; started gentle diuresis. WBC uptrend, fevers—workup for VAP started. CXR: improving pulmonary edema.  

**Day 4:**  
Extubated to HFNC. Diuresis ongoing. Impella wean attempted but patient became hypotensive; device left in place.  

**Day 5:**  
Improvement in urine output, but Hgb trended down to 8.1, likely iatrogenic/hemolysis from Impella. No overt bleeding.  

**Day 6:**  
Impella explanted after successful weaning; patient maintained MAP >65 mmHg without support.  

**Day 7:**  
Transferred to step-down after 24h of stable hemodynamics, off pressors and Impella.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, HFrEF (new, LVEF 15%)**
   - Etiology likely ischemic vs. viral (no prior echo available). STEMI ruled out, but troponin and global hypokinesis suggest possible myocarditis or severe ischemic insult.
   - Required Impella CP for hemodynamic support due to refractory shock.
   - Now off device, stable, plan GDMT initiation, close follow-up with HF team, outpatient cardiac MRI pending.

**2. Acute on Chronic Anemia**
   - Downtrend in Hgb (likely hemolysis, device-related, and phlebotomy losses).
   - Monitored, no transfusion required. Continue iron PO, f/u CBC.

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal)**
   - Likely 2/2 hypoperfusion. Improved with volume management and improved cardiac output.
   - Renal function improving, continue monitoring.

**4. Transaminitis**
   - Mild-moderate AST/ALT elevation, likely ischemic hepatitis; resolving as hemodynamics improve.

**5. Recurrent Sinusitis**
   - No evidence of acute bacterial infection on this admission; symptoms resolved.

**6. Osteoarthritis, hip**
   - Baseline discomfort, managed with PRN naproxen. Avoid NSAIDs given AKI—switched to acetaminophen.

**7. Hypertension, Prediabetes**
   - Off home meds during ICU stay; will restart as tolerated prior to discharge.

**8. Infection prevention**
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia ruled out; blood/urine cultures negative. Central line precautions maintained.

**9. DVT Prophylaxis**
   - On SCDs and SQ heparin.

**10. Disposition**
   - Step-down unit, pending PT/OT evaluation, outpatient cardiology f/u, consider advanced HF therapies if LVEF does not improve.

### Chief Complaint:
Acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock

---

### History of Present Illness:
Curtis Koelpin is a 21-year-old male with a remote history notable for recurrent otitis media, viral sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and prior episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis. He was previously healthy and active, taking only occasional antibiotics and over-the-counter analgesics. He presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest tightness, found to be hypoxic and hypotensive. Initial CXR showed pulmonary edema. Troponin mildly elevated; BNP 1840. Echo in ED showed severe global LV systolic dysfunction (EF 15%), mild RV dysfunction, no significant valvulopathy. He rapidly deteriorated to cardiogenic shock requiring intubation, vasopressors, and was transferred to the CICU.

Due to ongoing hemodynamic instability despite maximal medical therapy (dobutamine, norepinephrine), he underwent emergent placement of a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 1.

---

### Hospital Course (to date):

- **HD 1:** Admitted to CICU. Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Started on dobutamine, norepi, Lasix gtt. Impella CP placed for refractory cardiogenic shock.  
- **HD 2:** Improved MAPs, weaned norepi, extubated. Mild AKI developed (Cr 1.6 from 0.9 baseline).  
- **HD 3:** Impella support ongoing. Diuresis continued. Developed low-grade fever (Tmax 38.7°C). Blood cultures drawn.  
- **HD 4:** Clinical stabilization. Impella flows adequate. AKI resolving.  
- **HD 5:** Impella weaned and explanted. Transitioned to oral diuretics.  
- **HD 6:** Ambulating. No recurrent arrhythmias. LFTs normalized. Awaiting cardiac MRI.

### Problem List & Assessment/Plan

#### 1. Cardiogenic Shock (Resolved)
- Likely acute myocarditis vs. idiopathic DCM; viral prodrome
- Required Impella CP (HD 1–5), now explanted
- Remains hemodynamically stable off pressors/inotropes
- Plan: Await MRI, start GDMT if tolerated, monitor for HF recurrence

#### 2. Acute Decompensated Systolic HF
- Severe reduced EF (15% on TTE)
- Aggressive diuresis, now euvolemic
- Plan: Continue Lasix PO, consider ACEi/BB as tolerated, daily weights

#### 3. Acute Kidney Injury (Resolved)
- Likely prerenal, related to shock/diuresis
- Creatinine peaked at 1.6, now back to baseline
- Plan: Monitor renal function, maintain euvolemia

#### 4. Transaminitis (Resolved)
- Mild hepatic congestion/ischemia, improved with perfusion
- LFTs trending down
- Plan: Monitor

#### 5. Fever/Leukocytosis (Resolved)
- Tmax 38.7°C (HD 3), negative cultures, no source found
- Likely secondary to device/procedures
- Plan: No further abx

#### 6. Recent Intubation/Mechanical Ventilation (Resolved)
- Extubated HD 2, weaned O2, now on room air
- Plan: Incentive spirometry, ambulation

#### 7. Electrolyte Disturbances
- Mild hyponatremia/hyperkalemia during AKI, resolved
- Plan: Monitor BMP

#### 8. Nutrition
- NPO initially, now regular diet
- Plan: Monitor intake, consider cardiac rehab

#### 9. Disposition
- Monitor for clinical stability
- Await MRI, possible transfer to stepdown

---

### Discharge Planning
- Anticipate transfer to telemetry within 24-48 hrs if stable
- Cardiology, PT/OT, nutrition to follow

ADMISSION SUMMARY
===================================================================

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  
Progressive dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
Ms. Serrato is a 58-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and remote ankle sprain who presented to the ED with a 2-day history of worsening exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, non-productive cough, and pleuritic chest pain. She developed an episode of syncope at home. She was found to be hypotensive (SBP 82 mmHg) and tachycardic (HR 118 bpm) upon EMS arrival. She endorsed recent sore throat and malaise for 1 week, for which she began Penicillin V prescribed by her PCP. No known drug allergies. No prior history of heart failure, CAD, or arrhythmias.

On arrival to the ED, she was febrile (T 39.1°C), tachypneic (RR 29), and hypoxic (SpO₂ 89% RA). Initial labs were notable for leukocytosis, elevated troponin, and lactic acidosis. Chest X-ray: pulmonary edema. ECG: sinus tachycardia, non-specific ST/T changes. Echo: severely reduced LVEF (18%), global hypokinesis, no vegetations. She rapidly progressed to cardiogenic shock with evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion, requiring norepinephrine infusion and urgent transfer to the cardiac ICU.

Due to refractory shock, she underwent emergent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 1. She was managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and diuresis. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus pyogenes.

- Impella still in place, low flow alarms overnight, resolved with volume.  
- Renal function stable.  
- CXR: improving pulmonary edema.  
- No new fevers.

**Day 4:**  
- Impella weaned and explanted at bedside.  
- LVEF improved to 34% on echo.  
- Mobilized to chair.  
- Down-titrated antibiotics to complete 10-day course.  
- Blood cultures negative x2.

**Day 5:**

===================================================================
PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN
===================================================================

1. **Cardiogenic Shock, likely secondary to acute myocarditis (Strep pyogenes):**
   - Impella CP placed, now removed.
   - Vasopressors/inotropes weaned, hemodynamics stable.
   - Serial echo: LVEF improved from 18% → 34%.
   - Plan: Continue cardiac monitoring, daily weights, strict I/Os, cardiology f/u, ACEi initiation pending stability.

2. **Streptococcal pharyngitis with bacteremia:**
   - Blood cultures cleared, source control achieved.
   - Penicillin G IV x10 days, then transition to oral.
   - ID following.

3. **Acute hypoxic respiratory failure:**
   - Mechanical ventilation x48h, now extubated.
   - Pulmonary edema resolving.
   - Incentive spirometry, O2 wean.

4. **Acute kidney injury (resolved):**
   - Likely due to low perfusion; improved with hemodynamic support.
   - Renal function at baseline.

5. **Hemolysis (transient):**
   - Mild, likely related to Impella.
   - Monitoring LDH, haptoglobin. No transfusion needed.

6. **Thrombocytopenia (mild):**
   - Monitored daily, improved after device removal.

7. **Hypertension, Dyslipidemia:**
   - Continue home meds, monitor BP.
   - Statin resumed.

8. **Physical deconditioning:**
   - Early mobilization, PT/OT.

9. **Nutrition:**
   - High-protein diet, monitor intake.

10. **Pain:**
    - Mild, managed with acetaminophen.

===================================================================
DISCHARGE PLANNING (Anticipated)
===================================================================
- Stepdown to floor, then home with cardiac f/u.
- Outpatient echo in 2 weeks.
- Home health RN for wound care.
- Continue cardiac rehab, PT/OT.
- Education: HF signs, medication adherence, infection prevention.

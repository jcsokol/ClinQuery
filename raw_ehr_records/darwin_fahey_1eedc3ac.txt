**CHIEF COMPLAINT**  
Shortness of breath, chest tightness, fever

---

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**  
29yo male with hx of HTN, prediabetes, and recent URI who presented with 4 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and fevers. Initially treated as outpatient for presumed viral pharyngitis and sinusitis, but symptoms worsened, developing lower extremity edema, PND, and non-productive cough. On arrival to ED, found to be tachycardic, hypotensive, hypoxic, and febrile (Tmax 39.1°C). CXR with pulmonary vascular congestion, no focal infiltrates. EKG: NSR, borderline low voltage. Troponin elevated. Echo: severe global LV dysfunction, LVEF ~15%, moderate RV dysfunction, no valvular vegetations. Rapid deterioration requiring intubation, vasopressors, and urgent placement of a percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock secondary to suspected fulminant myocarditis.

Admitted to MICU for fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock. Emergent intubation, norepinephrine started. Echo with LVEF 15%. Vasodilatory shock persisted, requiring Impella CP placement. Broad spectrum abx (cefepime, vanc) started. Cardiac markers trended.  

**Day 2:**  
Hemodynamics improved with LVAD support. Lactate normalized. Still intubated. Fever persists. Blood cultures pending.  

**Day 3:**  
Extubated to HFNC. Down-titration of vasopressors. Renal function stable. Echo with mild improvement (LVEF 22%).  

**Day 4:**  
No arrhythmias. Weaned to nasal cannula. Impella settings decreased.  

**Day 5:**  
Low-grade fever. CRP, ESR elevated. Myocarditis panel sent. Troponin trending down.  

**Day 6:**  
LVAD weaned off and explanted. Hemodynamics stable.  

**Day 7:**  
Transferred to step-down.

**MICU ASSESSMENT & PLAN (Day 4)**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Fulminant Myocarditis**  
- Emergent Impella CP placed for LV support  
- Pressors weaned, now off  
- Daily TTE to monitor function  
- Plan: Continue close hemodynamic monitoring, consider advanced therapies if recurrent shock, continue telemetry

**2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**  
- Likely pulmonary edema from heart failure  
- Extubated, now on NC  
- Diuresis ongoing  
- Plan: Monitor O2, chest PT, fluid balance

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**  
- Likely secondary to hypoperfusion  
- Creatinine improved from 2.1 to 1.0  
- Plan: Monitor daily labs, avoid nephrotoxins

**4. Recent Acute Bacterial Sinusitis & Viral Pharyngitis**  
- Completed abx (amoxicillin-clavulanate)  
- No residual symptoms  
- Plan: No further intervention

**5. Prediabetes**  
- Recent A1c: 6.0%  
- Hyperglycemia likely stress-related  
- Plan: Monitor BG, endocrinology consult

**6. Hypertension**  
- Home meds held during shock  
- Now restarted  
- Plan: Titrate as tolerated

**7. Fever, Inflammatory Markers Elevated**  
- Blood, urine, sputum cultures negative  
- Myocarditis panel pending  
- Plan: Discontinue abx if cultures remain negative

**8. Physical Deconditioning**  
- Early PT/OT consult  
- Plan: Mobilize as tolerated

**9. Social/Disposition**  
- Lives alone, requires support  
- SW, case management involved  
- Plan: Anticipate SNF vs. home with services

---

**DISCHARGE PLANNING**  
- Anticipate transfer to floor, possible discharge in 3–5d  
- Cardiac MRI as outpatient  
- Close f/u with HF, cardiology  

---

**ORDERS**  
- Daily CBC, Chem7, Mg/Phos  
- Telemetry  
- DVT prophylaxis  
- PT/OT  
- Cardiac diet  
- Accuchecks q6h  
- IV fluids as needed

Worsening shortness of breath and chest tightness for 2 days.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

76-year-old male with past medical history significant for chronic sinusitis, obesity, hyperlipidemia, COPD, and recent viral upper respiratory infection, presenting to the ED with 2-day history of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and mild chest discomfort. Noted to have increased work of breathing and hypoxemia on arrival. Initial troponin elevated and EKG concerning for new LBBB. TTE in ED showed severe LV dysfunction (EF 20%) with global hypokinesis. He rapidly deteriorated, requiring transfer to MICU for escalating O2 requirements and hypotension despite fluids. Cardiogenic shock diagnosed (SBP ~70s). Temporary percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) placed on hospital day 2 for hemodynamic support.

### HOSPITAL COURSE & EVENTS

- **HD1:** Admitted with acute decompensated heart failure, rapidly progressing to cardiogenic shock.  
- **HD2:** Impella CP placed via femoral approach. Vasopressors weaned post-LVAD.  
- **HD3:** Gradual improvement in hemodynamics. Weaned down on ventilator settings.

- **HD5:** Extubated, transitioned to high flow O2, diuresis continued.  
- **HD6-7:** Stable, mild delirium, started on PT/OT.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, severe LV dysfunction**  
- Etiology likely ischemic vs. viral myocarditis.  
- Improved with Impella support and inotropes, now off vasopressors.  
- Continue aggressive diuresis, monitor for arrhythmias, daily TTE for LV recovery.  
- Consider guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF as tolerated.  
- Cardiology following.

**2. Acute on chronic kidney injury**  
- Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, diuretic use, underlying CKD.  
- Renal function improving. Monitor I/Os, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for GFR.

**3. COPD, severe (GOLD IV)**  
- On inhaled steroids/LABA, O2 to keep sats >92%.  
- Monitor for bronchospasm, daily chest PT.  
- Pulm consult.

**4. Hyperlipidemia**  
- Continue statin, recheck lipids when stable.

**5. Obesity**  
- Dietician consult, calorie restriction.

**6. Sinusitis/pharyngitis**  
- Supportive care, saline rinses, monitor for bacterial superinfection.

**7. Delirium**  
- Likely multifactorial (ICU, metabolic derangements).  
- Reorient frequently, minimize sedation, PT/OT.

**8. Laceration of hand (remote)**  
- Healed, no intervention needed.

### DISPOSITION

- Anticipate transfer to step-down unit in 48-72h if stable.
- Cardiac rehab referral pending.
- Close follow-up with cardiology, nephrology, and pulmonary after discharge.

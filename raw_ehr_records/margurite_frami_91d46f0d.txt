## Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

---

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
**Assessment:**  
38F with h/o hypertension, obesity, multiple prior pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, presents with 1 week of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. On arrival, hypotensive (MAP 58), tachycardic (HR 122), hypoxic (SpO2 89% RA), rales bilaterally, JVD, pitting edema. CXR: pulmonary edema. TTE: LVEF ~15%, global hypokinesis, mild MR. BNP 1920, troponin mildly elevated (0.13→0.17). Lactate 3.9. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine, furosemide drip. Worsening shock and end-organ hypoperfusion → Impella CP placed on HD2.  

**Plan:**  
- Maintain Impella support, monitor flows daily  
- Wean vasopressors/inotropes as tolerated  
- Daily TTE for LV recovery  
- Strict I/O, daily weights, fluid restriction  
- Continue IV Lasix, titrate to net negative  
- Consider advanced therapies (LVAD eval), transplant if no improvement  
- Serial troponin/BNP  
- Cardiac rehab consult PRN  
- DVT ppx: SCDs, heparin SQ  
- Telemetry, monitor for arrhythmia  

---

### 2. **Hypertension / Volume Overload**
**Assessment:**  
Chronic poorly controlled HTN, likely contributed to cardiac dysfunction. Now complicated by acute volume overload, requiring aggressive diuresis.  

**Plan:**  
- Hold oral antihypertensives while on vasoactive support  
- IV Lasix infusion, titrate to UOP >1cc/kg/hr  
- Monitor electrolytes q8h  
- Slow transition to oral agents as shock resolves  
- Low sodium diet  

---

### 3. **Obesity (BMI 30+)**
**Assessment:**  
BMI 29-31 during stay. Increases risk for HF, complicates volume management.  

**Plan:**  
- Nutrition consult  
- Calorie- and sodium-restricted diet  
- Encourage mobility/PT as tolerated  
- Monitor for wound/skin complications  

---

### 4. **Renal Dysfunction / AKI on CKD?**
**Assessment:**  
Rising creatinine (see labs), oliguria after admission. Likely multifactorial: cardiorenal syndrome, hypoperfusion, diuretics.  

**Plan:**  
- Nephrology following  
- Strict I/O, daily weights  
- Hold nephrotoxins  
- Renal dose adjust all meds  
- Monitor for need for RRT  

---

### 5. **Anemia of Chronic Disease**
**Assessment:**  
H/H trending down, likely multifactorial (hemodilution, CKD, acute illness). No overt bleeding.  

**Plan:**  
- Monitor CBC daily  
- Transfuse PRN if Hgb <7 or symptomatic  
- Iron studies, B12, folate  

---

### 6. **History of Recurrent Pregnancy Complications**
**Assessment:**  
Multiple prior pregnancies, several with preeclampsia, one blighted ovum, one first trimester miscarriage, now not currently pregnant (hCG neg). No acute OB concerns but high risk for future.  

**Plan:**  
- OB/GYN consult for long-term contraception, counseling  
- Monitor for gynecologic issues  

---

### 7. **Recent/Chronic Infections (Pharyngitis, Sinusitis, Bronchitis)**
**Assessment:**  
Remote h/o viral/bacterial URIs, currently no signs of infection. No fevers, procalcitonin WNL.  

**Plan:**  
- Monitor for secondary infection  
- Daily temp, WBC  
- No abx unless new evidence of infection  

---

### 8. **Pain / Sedation / Delirium**
**Assessment:**  
Mild pain at Impella insertion site, otherwise comfortable. Occasional mild delirium (ICU).  

**Plan:**  
- Acetaminophen PRN  
- Reorient, daily sedation vacation  
- Minimize benzos  
- Consult psych PRN for persistent delirium  

---

### 9. **DVT Prophylaxis**
**Assessment:**  
High risk due to immobility, obesity, HF.  

**Plan:**  
- SCDs  
- Heparin 5000u SQ q8h  
- Monitor platelets for HIT  

---

### 10. **Social / Discharge Planning**
**Assessment:**  
Lives alone, limited family support.  

**Plan:**  
- Early case management  
- Explore SNF vs home health  
- Social work consult

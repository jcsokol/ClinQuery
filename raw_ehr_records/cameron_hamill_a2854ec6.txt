### CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Cameron Hamill is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (on metformin), metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, anemia, and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, who presented to the ED with a 1-week history of progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, and bilateral leg swelling. He also reported fatigue, poor oral intake, and mild chest pressure without exertional component.

In the ED, he was found to be tachypneic and hypoxic (O2 sat 86% RA), BP 98/62, HR 119, with JVD and S3 on exam. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Troponin mildly elevated. Echo revealed LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR, and RV dysfunction. He was transferred to the CICU for management of acute decompensated heart failure, likely cardiogenic shock.

Despite initial IV diuresis, dobutamine and vasopressors, the patient remained hypotensive and oliguric. Cardiothoracic surgery consulted and patient underwent percutaneous placement of a left-sided Impella CP device on hospital day 2 for temporary mechanical circulatory support.

Subsequent course complicated by AKI (creatinine up to 2.1), transient lactic acidosis, anemia requiring transfusion, and an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with RVR. Device was weaned/removed on HD5 after cardiac output improved and end organ perfusion recovered.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN (Problem-based)

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock, Decompensated HFrEF (LVEF 15%)
- Etiology: Likely ischemic, chronic HTN/DM, possible viral insult
- Course: Required temporary mechanical support (Impella CP) x 48h
- Now stable off vasopressors/inotropes, euvolemic
- **Plan**:
    - Continue guideline-directed HF therapy (beta-blocker, ACEi, spironolactone titration as tolerated)
    - Daily weights, strict I/O, sodium restriction
    - Cardiac rehab consult
    - Monitor for arrhythmia, recurrent shock

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (prerenal, multifactorial)
- Peak Cr 2.11, now improving (1.12)
- Likely due to low CO, diuretic use, contrast
- **Plan**:
    - Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins
    - Renal dosing of all meds
    - Nephrology following

### 3. Anemia (chronic + acute on CKD)
- Hgb dropped to 10.7, transfused 1U PRBC
- No overt GI bleeding; stool hemoccult positive (baseline)
- **Plan**:
    - Monitor H/H
    - Iron studies, B12, folate pending
    - GI following for colon polyp hx

### 4. Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2), poorly controlled
- Admission A1c 8.2%, now on sliding scale insulin
- Metformin held during AKI, now resumed
- **Plan**:
    - Continue metformin, resume statin
    - Endocrinology to follow
    - Reinforce DM education

### 5. Secondary Hypertriglyceridemia / Metabolic Syndrome
- Triglycerides 124 (improved on statin)
- **Plan**:
    - Continue statin, consider fenofibrate if TG ↑
    - Dietician consult

### 6. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (new onset, s/p conversion)
- Occurred during ICU course, self-limited
- **Plan**:
    - Monitor telemetry, maintain K/Mg
    - Consider anticoagulation if recurs

### 7. Diabetic Retinopathy (nonproliferative)
- Stable, no acute changes
- **Plan**:
    - Ophtho outpatient f/u

### 8. OSA, Not on CPAP
- **Plan**:
    - Sleep study outpatient, consider inpatient trial if tolerated

### 9. Colon polyp (hx)
- Removed 2023, no recurrence
- **Plan**:
    - Routine surveillance

### 10. Miscellaneous
- GERD: on PPI
- Viral pharyngitis/sinusitis: supportive, resolved
- DVT prophylaxis: SCDs, LMWH

---

### DISPOSITION:
- Anticipate transfer to telemetry floor in 24h

**Physician's Comments:**  
Patient tolerated Impella removal well. Will need careful outpatient follow-up for advanced HF, DM, and CKD. Awaiting results of iron studies, will update plan as indicated. Family updated.

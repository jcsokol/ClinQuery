## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Mr. Sang Champlin, a 50-year-old male with a history of diabetes (on insulin and metformin), hypertension, prediabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, CKD stage 1, diabetic nephropathy, and metabolic syndrome, presented to the ED with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with evidence of hypoperfusion and worsening renal function. Notably, he developed cardiogenic shock refractory to medical therapy, requiring initiation of a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2 for hemodynamic support. The patient also had superimposed viral pharyngitis and sinusitis on admission.

### Hospital Course Timeline
- **Day 1:** Admitted to MICU for acute decompensated heart failure. Initial labs significant for hyperglycemia, worsening renal function, and mild anemia. Received IV furosemide, nitroglycerin, and BiPAP.
- **Day 2:** Developed hypotension (MAP <60), rising lactate, and oliguria. Swan-Ganz placed: CI 1.6, PCWP 28 mmHg. Vasopressors started. Cardiology placed percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP). 
- **Day 3-5:** Gradual improvement in end-organ perfusion. Renal function remained impaired, requiring close monitoring. Diuresis continued. Developed transient atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with amiodarone.
- **Day 6:** Impella weaned and explanted. Hemodynamics stable. Transitioned to oral HF medications.
- **Day 7-9:** Continued recovery. Down-titration of pressors and O2. Mobilized with PT. Discharge planning underway.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute on Chronic Systolic HF (EF est. 20%)
- **Assessment:** Decompensated HF secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, with hypotension and end-organ hypoperfusion. Required LVAD support.
- **Plan:**
    - Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan (initiated after hemodynamic stability).
    - Daily weights, strict I/Os, fluid restriction.
    - Follow up with advanced HF clinic post-discharge.
    - Consideration for ICD/CRT after further evaluation.

### 2. Temporary Mechanical Circulatory Support (Impella CP)
- **Assessment:** Device placed for refractory shock, explanted after 4 days.
- **Plan:**
    - Post-device monitoring for vascular complications, hemolysis (LDH, haptoglobin).
    - Serial echo to monitor ventricular function.
    - Anticoagulation: transitioned from heparin drip to apixaban at explant.

### 3. Diabetes Mellitus (on insulin, metformin)
- **Assessment:** Hyperglycemia on admission, improved with IV insulin; A1c 8.2%. Renal impairment limiting metformin use.
- **Plan:**
    - Hold metformin while GFR <45.
    - Continue basal-bolus insulin.
    - Endocrinology to adjust regimen prior to discharge.

### 4. CKD Stage 2 (baseline Cr 1.4, admission Cr 2.1)
- **Assessment:** AKI on CKD, likely prerenal from hypoperfusion.
- **Plan:**
    - Monitor renal function daily.
    - Avoid nephrotoxins.
    - Nephrology consult for ongoing management.

### 5. Hypertension
- **Assessment:** Well-controlled prior to admission, labile during ICU course.
- **Plan:**
    - Restart home antihypertensives as tolerated.
    - Monitor for hypotension post-LVAD.

### 6. Hypertriglyceridemia, Metabolic Syndrome
- **Assessment:** Triglycerides elevated, LDL moderately controlled.
- **Plan:**
    - Continue statin.
    - Recommend dietary consultation.

### 7. Anemia (Hb nadir 10.4)
- **Assessment:** Mild, multifactorial.
- **Plan:**
    - Iron studies pending.
    - Monitor for GI blood loss.

### 8. Viral Pharyngitis/Sinusitis
- **Assessment:** Mild symptoms, afebrile, resolving.
- **Plan:**
    - Supportive care.
    - ENT to follow if symptoms persist.

# ICU Progress Note

---

**Chief Complaint:**  
"Shortness of breath, chest pain, and lightheadedness for 2 days."

---

**History of Present Illness:**  
61-year-old male with a history of obesity, chronic intractable migraines, atopic dermatitis, and recent viral sinusitis who presented to the ED with acute onset of severe chest pain, dyspnea, and near-syncope. On arrival, he was tachycardic (HR 124), hypotensive (BP 82/54), and hypoxic (SpO2 89% RA). ECG: anterior STEMI. Troponin peaked at 12 ng/mL. Emergent cardiac cath revealed 100% occlusion of the proximal LAD. Underwent PCI with DES placement, but developed profound cardiogenic shock requiring pressors and subsequent placement of a temporary percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Admitted for acute anterior STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock. Required vasopressors and rapid escalation to percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for circulatory support. Over next 48-72h, hemodynamics improved, pressors weaned, and LVAD removed on HD4 with stable cardiac output. Renal function transiently worsened (Cr peak 1.34) but recovered. LFTs mildly elevated, likely ischemic hepatitis, resolved. No arrhythmias. Treated for aspiration pneumonia (fever, infiltrate on CXR HD2, started ceftriaxone/azithro x5 days). Atopic dermatitis flared, managed with topical steroids. Migraine prophylaxis continued. Discharged to cardiac rehab on HD7.

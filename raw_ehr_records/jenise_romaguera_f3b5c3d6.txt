### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue following 5 days of fever and upper respiratory symptoms.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
18-year-old female with history of recurrent sinusitis, otitis media, and prior ankle fracture, presented with 5 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, non-productive cough, subjective fevers, and myalgias. Initially evaluated for presumed viral URI; started on acetaminophen and ibuprofen at home. Worsening symptoms, including palpitations and mild confusion, prompted ED visit. In ED, found to be tachycardic (HR 128), hypotensive (BP 84/52), and hypoxic (SpO2 89% RA). CXR: mild pulmonary edema. Labs: elevated BNP, troponin mildly elevated. Echo: LVEF 18%. Admitted to ICU for acute decompensated heart failure, likely viral myocarditis.  

Rapid hemodynamic decline on hospital day 1: required norepinephrine and dobutamine infusions. On hospital day 2, due to refractory cardiogenic shock, underwent placement of a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) by interventional cardiology.

### PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (EF 18%)**  
- Likely due to acute viral myocarditis (Coxsackie B).  
- Required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support (HD2–7).  
- Slowly improving cardiac function; LVEF up to 38%.  
- PLAN: Continue GDMT for HF (carvedilol, lisinopril, furosemide as needed), daily echo, wean O2, monitor for arrhythmias, restrict fluids, monitor renal/liver function.

**2. Acute Viral Myocarditis**  
- Confirmed Coxsackie B.  
- No evidence of bacterial superinfection.  
- PLAN: Supportive care, continue monitoring, no antivirals indicated.

**3. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**  
- Secondary to pulmonary edema and poor cardiac output.  
- Intubated HD2–7, now extubated.  
- PLAN: Pulmonary hygiene, monitor ABGs, incentive spirometry.

**4. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**  
- Likely secondary to low cardiac output, improved with hemodynamics.  
- PLAN: Monitor labs, maintain euvolemia, avoid nephrotoxins.

**5. Transaminitis (mild)**  
- Likely ischemic hepatitis during shock. Trending down.  
- PLAN: Monitor LFTs.

**6. History of Recurrent Sinusitis/Otitis Media**  
- Not contributing to current presentation.  
- PLAN: Routine follow-up, no active infection.

**7. Nutrition/Mobility**  
- Initially NPO, now on cardiac diet.  
- Mobilizing with PT/OT.  
- PLAN: Advance diet as tolerated, continue PT.

**8. Psychosocial**  
- Young adult, significant stress, family at bedside.  
- PLAN: Social work consult, consider psych support.

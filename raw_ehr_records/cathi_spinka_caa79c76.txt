### CHIEF COMPLAINT

Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest discomfort

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

49-year-old woman with a history of prediabetes, prior miscarriage, remote 2nd degree burn, recurrent acute bronchitis, viral sinusitis, and recent wrist sprain, presenting with 1 week of worsening dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and chest heaviness. She initially presented to the ED with tachypnea, hypoxia, and hypotension, requiring escalating O2 and vasopressor support. Shortly after arrival, she developed acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.

Cardiology was consulted. Bedside echo revealed severely reduced LVEF (~10-15%), global hypokinesis, and moderate MR. Given refractory hypotension and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion, decision was made to place a left-sided Impella CP device for temporary mechanical circulatory support. She was transferred to the MICU. Since admission, she has required careful volume management, inotropic support, and serial labs to monitor for end-organ dysfunction and hemolysis.

### HOSPITAL COURSE

**Day 1 (5/21):**  
- Admitted to MICU, requiring norepinephrine and dobutamine.
- Echo: Severe global LV dysfunction, LVEF 10-15%, moderate MR, no LV thrombus.
- Labs notable for mild AKI, mild transaminitis, and lactic acidosis.

- Started on heparin for device.
- Foley placed, strict I/Os.

**Day 2:**

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Systolic HF (new, likely viral or idiopathic)**
   - Required Impella CP for temporary MCS, now explanted.
   - GDMT for HFrEF initiated (BB, ACEi, MRA).
   - Continue diuresis, monitor volume status.
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os.
   - Serial Echos: f/u in 1 week.
   - Cardiac MRI outpatient for etiology.
   - Consider advanced therapies if no improvement.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, multifactorial)**
   - Likely secondary to low cardiac output, improved with MCS.
   - Renal function improving; continue to monitor.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.

**3. Hemolysis (device-related)**
   - Monitored LDH, haptoglobin—improving post-device removal.
   - No evidence of overt bleeding.
   - Labs QAM x 3 days, then prn.

**4. Mild Transaminitis (shock liver)**
   - Downtrending LFTs.
   - Supportive care.

**5. Prediabetes**
   - Monitor glucose.
   - Nutrition and DM education.

**6. Remote 2nd-degree burn, miscarriage, wrist sprain, recurrent bronchitis/sinusitis**
   - No acute issues.

**7. Pain Management**
   - PRN acetaminophen/hydrocodone, acetaminophen, NSAIDs as needed (avoid NSAIDs if AKI worsens).

**8. VTE Prophylaxis**
   - SCDs, heparin while on Impella, now on SQ heparin.

**9. Disposition**
   - Continue PT/OT.
   - Anticipate transfer to stepdown once stable.

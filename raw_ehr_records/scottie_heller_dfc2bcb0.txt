### **CHIEF COMPLAINT**
Shortness of breath and chest pain, found hypotensive at home, brought in by EMS.

---

### **HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**
39-year-old male with a history of hypertension, prediabetes, anemia, chronic migraines, and recent acute viral pharyngitis and bronchitis, who presented to the ED after his wife found him confused and short of breath. On arrival, he was hypotensive (BP 76/48), tachycardic (HR 124), and hypoxic (SpO2 88% on room air). Noted to have cool extremities and delayed cap refill. CXR showed pulmonary edema. EKG: sinus tachycardia, no STEMI. Troponin elevated. Labs significant for acute on chronic anemia, AKI, and lactic acidosis. Echo: severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, moderate MR. Given evidence of cardiogenic shock, admitted to ICU, started on dobutamine and norepinephrine. Due to refractory shock, Impella CP (temporary LVAD) placed on hospital day 1.

### **HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY**
- **Day 1:** ICU admission for decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock. Emergent Impella CP placed via right femoral artery after unsuccessful escalation of inotropes/pressors. Started on IV furosemide, broad-spectrum abx for possible pneumonia. CVP 14, MAPs maintained >65 with vasoactives.
- **Day 2:** Improved mentation, weaned off norepinephrine. Ongoing oliguria, creatinine peaked at 2.2. Transfused 1U PRBCs for hgb 7.8. Echo: LVEF improved to 25% with Impella. Weaned sedation, extubated to HFNC.
- **Day 3:** Mobilizing in bed, Impella flow reduced, minimal pressor support. Diuresis ongoing. Troponin trending down. Developed mild transaminitis (AST 85, ALT 67). 
- **Day 4:** Impella removed at bedside. Remained stable off pressors. Diuresis continued, net negative 1.7L. Creatinine improving. 
- **Day 5:** Transferred to step-down unit. Vitals stable, O2 sat 97% on 2L NC. Cardiac MRI scheduled.

### **PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

#### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, new-onset severe systolic heart failure**
- Etiology likely viral myocarditis vs. ischemic insult (troponin elevation w/o clear STEMI).
- Required Impella CP for circulatory support (HD 1-4).
- Plan: Continue guideline-directed medical therapy, monitor for arrhythmia, serial EKGs, repeat echo prior to DC, consider referral for advanced HF therapies if no recovery.

#### 2. **Acute on Chronic Anemia**
- Hgb on arrival: 7.8, likely multifactorial (chronic disease, hemolysis, acute hemodilution)
- PRBC transfusion x1.
- Plan: Monitor CBC daily, continue iron, GI workup if persistent.

#### 3. **Acute Kidney Injury**
- Likely pre-renal from hypoperfusion.
- Peak Cr 2.2, improved to 1.4 on HD 5.
- Plan: Monitor I/Os, avoid nephrotoxins, renal consult if worsens.

#### 4. **Volume Overload / Pulmonary Edema**
- Managed with aggressive IV diuresis.
- Plan: Continue diuresis, monitor lytes, daily weights.

#### 5. **Prediabetes**
- No acute issues, BG 65-110 during stay.
- Plan: Monitor, A1c 5.8%, lifestyle counseling on discharge.

#### 6. **Chronic Migraines**
- No headaches during ICU stay.
- Plan: Resume home meds as tolerated.

#### 7. **Hypertension**
- Off anti-HTN during acute phase, now normotensive.
- Plan: Restart low-dose HCTZ, titrate as tolerated.

#### 8. **Recent Viral Pharyngitis/Bronchitis**
- No ongoing respiratory infection.
- Plan: Abx course completed, monitor for secondary infection.

#### 9. **Remote Third Degree Burn**
- No current sequelae.

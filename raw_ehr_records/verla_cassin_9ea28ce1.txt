### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Ms. Cassin is a 46-year-old woman with a history of obesity, recurrent sinusitis, prior normal pregnancy, cystitis, and chronic bronchitis who presented to the ED with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and pleuritic chest pain. On arrival, she was tachypneic, tachycardic, and hypoxic. Initial workup revealed elevated troponin, BNP, and CXR with pulmonary edema. She was admitted to the ICU for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), likely secondary to new-onset non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15% on TTE). Despite aggressive diuresis and inotropic support, she became hypotensive and developed worsening end-organ dysfunction. A percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 2 for cardiogenic shock.

Her course was complicated by AKI, transaminitis, and nosocomial pneumonia. She was successfully weaned from temporary mechanical support on day 7 and transitioned to oral heart failure therapies. She remains in the ICU for monitoring and ongoing diuresis.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN (Problem-Based)

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, New-Onset Systolic Heart Failure (EF 15%)**  
- Likely viral myocarditis vs. idiopathic non-ischemic CM  
- Required Impella CP placement for hemodynamic support (HD2-7); now weaned  
- On GDMT: Carvedilol, low-dose Entresto, aldactone (initiated HD7)  
- Monitor for arrhythmias, volume status, end-organ function  
- Daily TTEs x 3, then qod; serial cardiac enzymes  
- Cardiac MRI pending (outpatient)

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO Stage 2, peak Cr 2.3, baseline 1.1)**  
- Multifactorial: low output, diuretics, transient nephrotoxic exposure  
- Improved with hemodynamic recovery  
- Nephrology following  
- Strict I/Os, daily BMPs

**3. Acute Transaminitis**  
- AST/ALT peaked at 92/110 (HD3), likely ischemic hepatitis  
- Downtrending, no evidence of viral hepatitis (Hep panel neg)  
- Monitor LFTs

**4. Recurrent Sinusitis, Recent Bronchitis**  
- Started empiric ceftriaxone + azithro (HD1-4), narrowed to ceftriaxone for 48h pending cultures  
- ENT consult: no surgical intervention needed  
- Monitor for secondary infections

**5. Obesity (BMI 30+)**  
- DVT ppx with SCDs, low-dose heparin  
- Nutrition consult for low-sodium, cardiac diet  
- Encourage early mobilization as tolerated

**6. Nosocomial Pneumonia (developed HD5)**  
- New fever, leukocytosis, CXR with infiltrate  
- Started vanc/zosyn, improved clinically  
- Will reassess abx in 48h

**7. GU: Cystitis (remote), Mirena IUD/Etonogestrel**  
- No current GU sx, urine cx negative  
- IUD and implant in situ, no concerns

**8. Contraceptive Management**  
- Home regimen held during critical illness  
- Will reassess prior to discharge

**9. Pain/Comfort**  
- Mild, managed with Tylenol PRN  
- No opioids required

**10. Disposition**  
- Remains in ICU for monitoring post-Impella  
- Anticipated transfer to stepdown in 2-3 days if stable  
- Close f/u with Cardiology, Nephrology, and PCP post-discharge

**Significant Events:**  
- 4/15: Admitted to ICU, started on dobutamine, lasix  
- 4/16: Impella CP placed, improved MAPs  
- 4/17: AKI, transaminitis peaked

# Admission H&P Summary

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest heaviness x 4 days.

**History of Present Illness:**  
59 y/o F with a history of COPD, obesity, chronic anemia, and multiple prior pregnancies (including miscarriage and blighted ovum), presenting with acutely worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Reported increased cough, wheeze, and 2-pillow orthopnea. No fevers/chills. Noted decreased urine output and mild confusion on day of admission. On arrival, found to be hypoxic (SpO2 85% RA), tachycardic (HR 121), hypertensive (BP 162/98), tachypneic (RR 28), and with rales and JVD. CXR: pulmonary edema. Troponin mildly elevated, BNP 1324, EKG: NSR w/ LVH. Echo: Severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF 15%), global hypokinesis, mild MR, RV mildly reduced.

Quickly deteriorated with hypotension refractory to diuresis and vasodilators. Required intubation and placement of a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock.

# ICU Course Summary

**Day 1:**  
Admitted with acute decompensated heart failure, respiratory failure. Intubated for hypoxemia. Started on IV furosemide, nitroglycerin, and BiPAP. Worsening hypotension, evidence of poor perfusion (lactate 4.2, Cr up from 0.8 to 1.6). Started on norepinephrine. Cardiology consulted. Echo: EF 15%. Decision made for temporary LV support. Impella CP placed via right femoral artery.

**Day 2:**  
Hemodynamics improved, weaned off norepinephrine. Net negative 2.4L fluids. CXR: improving edema. Developed mild hemolysis (LDH 511, haptoglobin <10). Hgb dropped to 8.2. No active bleeding. Monitored closely.

**Day 3:**  
Slow improvement. Impella flows stable. Extubated to HFNC. Mental status improved. Renal function recovering. Diuresis continued.

**Day 4:**  
Impella weaned and removed. Echo: EF improved to 28%. Remained stable off pressors. Mobilized to chair.

# Problem List & Assessment/Plan

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock, Severe LV Systolic Dysfunction  
- **Assessment:** Acute decompensated heart failure on background of chronic cardiac dysfunction, likely ischemic vs. tachycardia-induced, with profound LV impairment requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Impella CP placed, removed after 72h as hemodynamics stabilized  
  - Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF: start low-dose carvedilol, lisinopril  
  - Monitor for arrhythmia, repeat echo in 1 week  
  - Restrict fluids, daily weights  
  - Cardiac rehab consult  

## 2. COPD (Severe)  
- **Assessment:** Baseline severe obstruction, recent exacerbation likely due to HF and fluid overload.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Resume home inhalers (fluticasone/salmeterol)  
  - Incentive spirometry  
  - Monitor for bronchospasm  
  - Pulm follow-up  

## 3. Anemia (Chronic, with acute drop)  
- **Assessment:** Baseline Hgb ~10, dropped to 8.2 with mild hemolysis (likely device-related). No overt bleeding.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor Hgb q12h  
  - Transfuse if <7.5  
  - Iron studies, B12, folate, retic count pending  
  - Stop device; monitor for further hemolysis  

## 4. Obesity  
- **Assessment:** BMI 29; risk factor for HF, OSA, and pulmonary disease.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Dietician consult  
  - Calorie-restricted diet  
  - Encourage mobilization as tolerated  

## 5. Recurrent Cystitis  
- **Assessment:** No UTI sx during this admission.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor for UTI  
  - Nitrofurantoin PRN  
  - Remove Foley ASAP  

## 6. Gynecologic History  
- **Assessment:** Multiple prior pregnancies, 1 miscarriage, 1 blighted ovum.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue current contraception  
  - Routine GYN follow-up  

## 7. Electrolyte Abnormalities  
- **Assessment:** Mild hyponatremia, hypokalemia during diuresis.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Replete K/Mg as needed  
  - Monitor BMP daily

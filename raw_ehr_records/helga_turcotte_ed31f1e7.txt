Patient Name: Helga Turcotte            MRN: 00214829          FIN: 3840271
DOB: 07/20/1980 (Age: 43)               Sex: Female            Admit Date: 03/06/2024
Attending: Dr. Sarah Kim, MD            Service: Cardiology ICU

-------------------
HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY
-------------------
Ms. Helga Turcotte is a 43-year-old female with a history of chronic hypertension, recurrent upper respiratory infections, and multiple prior normal pregnancies, who presented to the ED with acute onset chest pain, severe dyspnea, and orthopnea. She was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with evidence of cardiogenic shock, requiring ICU admission and urgent placement of a temporary left-sided Impella heart pump for hemodynamic support.

The patient’s hospital stay was notable for a complicated ICU course, including acute renal injury, mild transaminitis, and a prolonged wean from mechanical circulatory support. She required aggressive diuresis, vasopressors, and close monitoring for arrhythmias and infection.

-------------------
PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN
-------------------

1. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure with Cardiogenic Shock**
   - Presentation: Acute SOB, chest pain, hypoperfusion. Echo: Severe LV systolic dysfunction, EF 15%, moderate MR.
   - Treatment: Initiated dobutamine and norepinephrine. Impella CP placed for LV unloading.
   - Monitoring: Daily TTEs, serial lactates, strict fluid balance, hemodynamics via PA catheter.
   - Plan: Titrate off vasopressors, continue Impella until cardiac output >4L/min, consider transition to durable LVAD if no recovery.

2. **Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO Stage 2)**
   - Likely multifactorial: cardiorenal syndrome, low perfusion.
   - Labs: Cr peaked at 2.1 (baseline 0.9), BUN 38.
   - Plan: Renal dose diuretics, avoid nephrotoxins, daily renal panel. Nephrology consulted.

3. **Hypertension**
   - History of chronic HTN, on HCTZ at baseline.
   - BP labile during ICU stay; holding antihypertensives during shock.
   - Plan: Will restart HCTZ and consider ACEi when hemodynamics stabilize.

4. **Mild Transaminitis**
   - Labs: AST 82, ALT 97 (peak), likely ischemic hepatitis.
   - Plan: Monitor LFTs, avoid hepatotoxic meds.

5. **Arrhythmia - Paroxysmal AF with RVR**
   - Developed on day 2, HR 140s, self-terminated after IV amiodarone.
   - Plan: Continue telemetry, PRN amio.

6. **Volume Overload/Pulmonary Edema**
   - Managed with IV furosemide, ultrafiltration x 2 days.
   - Plan: Daily weights, I/O, chest imaging.

7. **Infection Risk (ICU, Impella in situ)**
   - No fever, WBC 9.7-12.0. Blood cx negative.
   - Plan: Line care, daily cultures if fever.

8. **Reproductive Health**
   - Hx multiple pregnancies, on OCPs.
   - Plan: Hold OCPs for now, Gyn consult for long-term contraception post-discharge.

9. **Psychosocial/Disposition**
   - Significant stress, husband at bedside.
   - Plan: Social work, psych support, discuss advanced care planning if needed.

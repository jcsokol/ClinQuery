## Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, chest tightness, confusion

---

## History of Present Illness:
Jospeh Dietrich is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent acute viral pharyngitis, and laceration of the right hand (sutured in ED 5 days ago), presenting with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and confusion. He was noted by family to be increasingly somnolent and diaphoretic at home. Upon arrival to the ED, he was hypotensive (SBP 78 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 122), hypoxic (SpO2 89% RA).  

Initial workup revealed elevated troponin, BNP, and evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR. Echo demonstrated severely reduced LV systolic function (EF ~15%), global hypokinesis, and mild RV dysfunction. He rapidly decompensated, requiring intubation and vasopressor support. Despite maximal medical therapy (dobutamine, norepinephrine), he remained in cardiogenic shock. Cardiology and CT surgery were consulted, and a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed emergently at bedside on hospital day 1 with good hemodynamic response.

## Review of Systems:  
Unable to obtain complete ROS due to intubation and sedation.

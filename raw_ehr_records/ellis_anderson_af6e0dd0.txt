27-year-old female with a history notable for recent viral pharyngitis and sinusitis, who presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and pleuritic chest pain. On day of admission, developed acute syncope at home. Bystanders report brief unresponsiveness, EMS found pt hypotensive (SBP 70s), tachycardic, cool extremities. On arrival, required oxygen and fluid resuscitation. Initial workup revealed elevated troponin, diffuse ST changes, and echo with severely reduced LVEF (~15%). Emergent temporary LVAD placed for cardiogenic shock.

- First degree burn (remote, resolved)  
- Acute viral pharyngitis (recent)  
- Fracture of rib (remote, trauma)  
- Closed fracture of hip (remote, trauma)

### ICU Course Summary

#### Hospital Day 1 (Admission):

#### Hospital Day 2–3:
- Gradual improvement in perfusion, LVAD weaning trials
- Extubated on HD2, mentation improved
- ID consulted: viral myocarditis suspected, respiratory PCR positive for coxsackie B
- Cardiac MRI: diffuse myocardial edema, consistent with myocarditis
- LFTs trended up with shock liver, improving

#### Hospital Day 4–6:
- LVAD support weaned off on HD5, device explanted without complication

- Cardiac rehab initiated
- Mobilization with PT/OT

#### Hospital Day 7–8 (Current):
- Off vasopressors, hemodynamically stable
- Discharge planning underway

### Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

#### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock/Myocarditis (Resolved)**
   - Temporary LVAD (Impella) placed, now explanted
   - Transitioned to oral HF therapy
   - Cardiac MRI: viral myocarditis (coxsackie B)
   - Plan: Continue GDMT, monitor for arrhythmias, repeat echo in 1 month, avoid strenuous activity x3 months

#### 2. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure (Resolved)**
   - Intubated HD1, extubated HD2
   - No pneumonia/ARDS
   - Plan: Incentive spirometry, pulmonary rehab

#### 3. **Shock Liver (Improving)**
   - Transaminitis peaked on HD2, improving
   - Plan: Monitor LFTs, supportive care

#### 4. **Acute Kidney Injury (Resolved)**
   - Pre-renal AKI, baseline Cr 0.8 → peak 1.7, now 1.0
   - Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins

#### 5. **Pain Management**
   - Rib/hip fracture pain, managed with Tylenol/PRN NSAIDs
   - Plan: Continue PRN, monitor for side effects

#### 6. **Contraceptive Management**
   - Multiple OCPs on home meds, held during hospitalization
   - Plan: Resume single OCP at discharge pending hypercoagulability risk

#### 7. **Physical Deconditioning**
   - Plan: PT/OT, cardiac rehab

#### 8. **Psychosocial**
   - Debriefed re: ICU stay, provided support resources

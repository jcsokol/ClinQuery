**MRN:** 00421987  
**DOB:** 01/05/1956  
**Sex:** Female  
**Admitting Physician:** Dr. Andrew Patel  
**Date of Admission:** 04/13/2024  
**Date of Note:** 04/20/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. H. Mendez  
**Encounter:** ICU - Cardiac

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema

---

**History of Present Illness:**  
Sonia Gracia is a 68-year-old female with past medical history notable for obesity, recurrent upper respiratory infections, and remote miscarriage, who presented to the ED with 5 days of worsening dyspnea, PND, and bilateral leg swelling. On arrival, she was tachypneic, hypertensive, and hypoxic on room air. She reported mild chest discomfort and a dry cough. She denied fever, recent travel, or sick contacts. She has a history of poorly controlled hypertension and obesity (BMI ~30). She was admitted for presumed acute decompensated heart failure.  

On hospital day 2, she acutely decompensated, developing hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation and escalating vasopressors. TTE revealed severe global hypokinesis with EF estimated at 12%, likely new. She was transferred to the cardiac ICU and an Impella CP device was placed for temporary LV support.  

---

**Hospital Course (Summary):**  
- **Day 1:** Admitted for acute decompensated HF; initial diuresis started, but worsening renal function and persistent hypoxia.
- **Day 2:** Developed cardiogenic shock, required norepinephrine, subsequently Impella CP placed. Intubated for respiratory failure.
- **Day 3-5:** Gradual improvement in hemodynamics, weaned off vasopressors. Renal function improved with CVVH.  
- **Day 6:** Extubated, Impella weaned and removed.
- **Day 7:** Transferred to step-down unit, ongoing diuresis and physical therapy.

**Assessment and Plan (Problem-Based):**  

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, s/p Impella (Resolved)**  
- Etiology: Acute decompensated HFrEF, likely ischemic or idiopathic  
- Course: Required Impella for 48 hrs, now off device and vasopressors  
- Plan: Continue aggressive HF management (GDMT), monitor for low-output symptoms, repeat TTE in 1 week, consider cardiac MRI outpatient, monitor electrolytes, daily weights, fluid restrict

**2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure, New HFrEF**  
- Initiated IV Lasix, transitioned to PO as renal function recovered  
- Started low-dose carvedilol and lisinopril, titrating as tolerated  
- Sodium/fluid restriction, daily weights, PT/OT for conditioning  
- Outpatient referral to HF clinic, consider advanced therapies if EF remains <25%

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**  
- Likely secondary to low perfusion state, now improved  
- Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, continue gentle diuresis

**4. Acute Respiratory Failure, s/p Intubation**  
- Extubated, on 2L O2, weaning to RA  
- Incentive spirometry, monitor for reaccumulation of edema

**5. Obesity**  
- Dietary consult, encourage weight loss  
- Plan outpatient weight management referral

**6. Rotator Cuff Tendon Injury (remote)**  
- No acute intervention, encourage PT as tolerated

**7. Remote miscarriage, sinusitis, bronchitis, viral pharyngitis**  
- No active issues

**8. Discharge Planning**  
- Anticipate discharge to home with family  
- Arrange close outpatient follow-up (cardiology, HF clinic, PCP)  
- Home health nursing to assist with medication management

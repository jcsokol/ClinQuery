### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema x 2 weeks. Presented to ED with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
59-year-old woman with PMH significant for hypertension, obesity (BMI ~30), prediabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic anemia, and recent URI (viral pharyngitis and bacterial sinusitis) presents with 2 weeks of worsening shortness of breath, fatigue, and leg swelling. Initially attributed to viral infection but worsened despite antibiotics (amox/clav). On day of admission, she developed severe orthopnea, PND, and was found to be hypoxic at home. EMS brought her to the ED where she was tachypneic, hypoxic (O2 sat 84% RA), with BP 82/54 mmHg, HR 124. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Echo: severe global LV dysfunction (EF ~15%), moderate MR, RV mildly reduced. Troponin mildly elevated. NT-proBNP 18,000 pg/mL.

She was admitted to MICU, started on BiPAP, then intubated for worsening hypoxemia and mental status. Developed cardiogenic shock refractory to pressors/inotropes. Emergent placement of percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) on HD2.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure, new severe LV dysfunction)**
- Etiology likely nonischemic (viral myocarditis vs. stress-induced, ischemic workup pending)
- Required Impella CP for hemodynamic support (HD2-7)
- Now off vasopressors, weaning advanced support
- *Plan*: Continue hemodynamic monitoring, daily TTE, transition to IABP, evaluate for durable LVAD/transplant

**2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
- Intubated (HD1-6), failed early extubation
- Now extubated, on high-flow nasal cannula
- *Plan*: Pulm hygiene, monitor for reintubation, SBT daily

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (prerenal, multifactorial)**
- Likely secondary to shock, diuresis, nephrotoxic exposure
- Creat peaked 1.5, now improved
- *Plan*: IV fluids as needed, monitor UOP, avoid nephrotoxins

**4. Acute Liver Injury (shock liver)**
- Transaminitis peaked HD3, now improving
- *Plan*: Monitor LFTs, supportive care

**5. Anemia, chronic**
- Baseline Hgb ~11, nadir 9.8, stable, no transfusion needed
- *Plan*: Monitor, iron studies pending

**6. Hyperlipidemia, Obesity, Prediabetes**
- On statin, dietary consult, glucose controlled
- *Plan*: Continue home meds, dietician follow-up

**7. Recent Sinusitis/Pharyngitis (resolving)**
- Completed abx, afebrile, no further symptoms
- *Plan*: Observe, no further antibiotics

**8. DVT Prophylaxis**
- SCDs, SQ heparin

**9. Social/Disposition**
- Psychosocial support, early transplant evaluation
- *Plan*: SW consult, family meeting

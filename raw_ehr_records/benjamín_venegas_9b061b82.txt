# ICU Progress Note

## Chief Complaint
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest discomfort for 2 days.  

## HPI
63 yo M with hx of HTN, prediabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic anemia, and recent viral pharyngitis, presenting with 2 days of worsening dyspnea, PND, orthopnea, and mild chest pain. He had an episode of near-syncope at home, prompting ED evaluation. He was initially hypertensive, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic (O2 sat 88% RA). CXR and bedside echo concerning for acute decompensated heart failure with reduced EF (~20%). Troponin elevated, NT-proBNP >10,000.  

Despite IV diuresis, patient acutely decompensated with hypotension and worsening end-organ perfusion. Required escalating pressors and was transferred to the ICU. Given refractory cardiogenic shock, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed for temporary mechanical circulatory support.

## Hospital Course Summary

- **Day 1-2:** Admitted to ED, decompensated in observation, transferred to ICU.  
- **Day 2:** Developed worsening hypotension, evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion (AKI, elevated LFTs, rising lactate). Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine.  
- **Day 3:** Cardiology consulted, Impella CP placed via femoral access. Gradual improvement in MAP, decreased inotropes.  
- **Day 4-5:** Weaning off vasopressors. Renal function improved. Still requiring support for low output state.  
- **Day 6:** Impella weaned, removed without complication.  
- **Day 7:** Transferred to step-down unit.

# Problem List & Assessment/Plan

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock, HFrEF (EF ~20%)
- Acute decompensated HF with evidence of low output, requiring temporary mechanical support (Impella).  
- Etiology: Likely ischemic cardiomyopathy, possibly demand ischemia on background of CAD/HTN.  
- **Plan:**
  - Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) as tolerated (BB, ACEi/ARB, MRA, statin)
  - Monitor for arrhythmias, optimize volume status
  - Daily weights, strict I/O, adjust diuretics
  - Troponin trending, echo repeat before transfer
  - Cardiology to follow, consider advanced HF therapies if recurrent decompensation

## 2. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO 2)
- Likely multifactorial: low output, pre-renal azotemia, possible nephrotoxic meds.
- **Plan:**
  - Hold nephrotoxins (NSAIDs d/c’d)
  - Monitor chem7, UA, urine output
  - Nephrology consulted
  - Renal function improved with support

## 3. Chronic Anemia (baseline Hgb ~11, now 9.8)
- Multifactorial: CKD, chronic disease, possible iron deficiency.
- **Plan:**
  - Iron panel, B12, folate pending
  - Transfuse if Hgb <7 or symptomatic
  - GI consult if ongoing drop

## 4. Hypertension
- Longstanding, suboptimally controlled.
- **Plan:**
  - Resume home HCTZ and add ACEi when stable
  - Monitor for hypotension as HF meds uptitrated

## 5. Hyperlipidemia
- LDL 97, on simvastatin.
- **Plan:**
  - Continue statin
  - Consider high-intensity statin if tolerated

## 6. Prediabetes
- A1c 5.9%
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor glucose, dietician consult
  - No insulin/PO agents needed

## 7. Recent Viral Pharyngitis
- Resolved, no ongoing symptoms.
- **Plan:**
  - Supportive care only

## 8. Wrist Sprain
- Mild right wrist pain, no swelling.
- **Plan:**
  - Ice/acetaminophen prn (avoid NSAIDs due to AKI)
  - PT referral if persistent

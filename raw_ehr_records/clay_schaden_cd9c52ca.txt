### HPI

21-year-old male with no significant past medical history except for recent viral sinusitis, presented to the ED 5/28/2024 with 3-day history of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Noted to have a viral prodrome (low-grade fevers, myalgias, sinus congestion) one week prior. On arrival, he was found to be tachycardic (HR 122), hypotensive (BP 80/40), tachypneic (RR 32), and hypoxic (O2 sat 88% RA). Exam notable for JVD, S3, rales, cool extremities. CXR: pulmonary edema. Echo: severe global LV dysfunction, LVEF ~10%.  
Patient rapidly deteriorated, requiring vasopressors and intubation. Due to refractory cardiogenic shock, a temporary left-sided Impella CP device was placed on 5/29/2024. Transferred to ICU for further management.

### Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

**1. Cardiogenic shock secondary to presumed viral myocarditis**  
- Severe LV dysfunction, likely post-viral myocarditis (recent viral URI, echo findings)  
- Required Impella CP for circulatory support (inserted 5/29/2024)  
- Currently weaning off vasopressors (down to norepinephrine 2 mcg/min)  
- Echo 6/2: LVEF improved to 25%  
- Plan:  
  - Continue Impella support, goal to wean as tolerated  
  - Daily TTE to monitor recovery  
  - Continue inotropes and vasopressors as needed  
  - Monitor for device complications (hemolysis, limb ischemia)  
  - ID consult for viral/autoimmune workup  
  - Cardiology to follow for possible advanced therapies if no improvement  

**2. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, intubated**  
- Intubated 5/28 for hypoxia and increased work of breathing  
- Ventilator settings: PRVC, TV 6mL/kg, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%  
- CXR 6/2: improving pulmonary edema  
- Plan:  
  - Daily SBTs, continue lung protective ventilation  
  - Diuresis as tolerated  
  - Monitor for VAP  

**3. Acute kidney injury (AKI)**  
- Baseline Cr ~0.7, peaked at 2.3 on 5/30, now trending down to 1.2  
- Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, diuretics, contrast  
- UOP improving with hemodynamic stabilization  
- Plan:  
  - Monitor UOP and daily labs  
  - Avoid nephrotoxins  
  - Renal dosing for all meds  

**4. Transaminitis**  
- AST/ALT peaked at 2,000/1,500 (5/29), now downtrending (AST 320, ALT 210)  
- Likely ischemic hepatitis from shock  
- Plan:  
  - Monitor LFTs  
  - No hepatotoxic meds  
  - Supportive care  

**5. Thrombocytopenia**  
- Platelets dropped to 70K on 5/30, now 142K  
- No evidence of bleeding  
- Possibly device-related, or consumptive  
- Plan:  
  - Monitor CBC daily  
  - No anticoagulation unless indicated  

**6. Nutrition**  
- NPO initially, now on NG tube feeds, goal 25 kcal/kg  
- Plan:  
  - Continue tube feeds  
  - Monitor for refeeding, glucose  

**7. DVT prophylaxis**  
- Sequential compression devices  
- No pharmacologic prophylaxis due to thrombocytopenia  

**8. Social/Disposition**  
- Lives with parents, college student  
- Mother at bedside daily  
- Plan:  
  - SW/Case management to follow  
  - Family meetings for updates

# PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock, Severe LV Dysfunction (EF 15%)
- Etiology: Likely viral myocarditis (recent URI), possible ischemic insult
- Course: Required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for 5 days
- Plan:  
  - Continue GDMT for HFrEF (ACEi/ARB, BB when stable, spironolactone)
  - Cardiac MRI outpatient to assess for myocarditis
  - Evaluate for ICD at follow-up
  - Strict I/Os, daily weights

## 2. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO III), Oliguric → Improving
- Multifactorial: Low perfusion, possible nephrotoxins, NSAIDs
- CRRT x 2 days, now off, improving
- Plan:  
  - Avoid nephrotoxins (no NSAIDs)
  - Monitor renal function daily
  - Nephrology to follow

## 3. Anemia (Multifactorial; chronic + acute on chronic)
- Hgb nadir 8.3, transfused 1U PRBC
- Plan:  
  - Monitor CBC
  - Iron studies, B12/folate pending
  - GI evaluation outpatient if ongoing

## 4. Gout Flare (L great toe)
- Precipitated by illness/AKI
- Plan:  
  - Prednisone taper started
  - Hold NSAIDs due to AKI
  - Continue allopurinol, colchicine

## 5. Hyperlipidemia
- Off statin during AKI, now resumed
- Plan:  
  - Simvastatin 10mg QHS
  - Dietician consult

## 6. Delirium (ICU, multifactorial)
- Improving with reduction of sedatives, improved perfusion
- Plan:  
  - Reorient, minimize restraints
  - PT/OT, early mobilization

## 7. Recent Viral URI (now resolving)
- Monitor for secondary infection
- Plan:  
  - Supportive care

## 8. Prediabetes
- Glucose stable, A1c 5.8%
- Plan:  
  - Monitor, dietician to see

## 9. Pain Control
- Gout flare, post-procedure
- Plan:  
  - Acetaminophen scheduled
  - Hydrocodone/acetaminophen PRN

## 10. Infectious Concerns
- No growth on cultures
- Procalcitonin negative
- Plan:  
  - Discontinue antibiotics if afebrile x48h

# DISCHARGE PLANNING

- Education on heart failure, medication adherence
- Outpatient cardiology, nephrology, and primary care follow-up
- Home health for medication management, wound care (Impella site)
- No driving until cleared by cardiology
- 24/7 contact for symptoms: SOB, chest pain, syncope

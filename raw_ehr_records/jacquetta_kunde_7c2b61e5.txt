**Epic EHR - ICU Progress Note**

**Patient Name:** Jacquetta Kunde  
**MRN:** 11902834  
**DOB:** 05/11/1954  
**Sex:** Female  
**Date of Admission:** 04/09/2024  
**Date of Note:** 04/14/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. M. Healy  
**Consultants:** Cardiology, Infectious Diseases, Endocrinology, General Surgery

---

**Chief Complaint**  
Shortness of breath, chest pressure, and progressive lower extremity edema.  

**History of Present Illness**  
Jacquetta Kunde is a 69-year-old female with significant past medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity (BMI 30+), prediabetes, anemia, recurrent colon polyps, and a remote history of overlapping malignant neoplasm of the colon (s/p partial colectomy 2017), who presented to the ED with a 3-day history of progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, non-productive cough, and lower extremity swelling. She reports mild chest discomfort, but denies fevers, chills, or palpitations. She has had increased fatigue and decreased appetite.  

On arrival, she was tachypneic, mildly hypoxic (O2 sat 91% on RA), and hypotensive (BP 87/52 mmHg). She was found to have acute decompensated heart failure with evidence of cardiogenic shock. She was transferred to ICU for further management.  

---

**Hospital Course (Days 1-5):**  
- Day 1: Initial stabilization with BiPAP, IV diuresis, vasopressors. Cardiology consulted for shock.  
- Day 2: Worsening hemodynamics despite medical management. Bedside echo: severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF ~15%), moderate MR, dilated IVC. Decision made for temporary percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) placement for cardiogenic shock.  
- Day 3: Clinical improvement on mechanical support. Weaned off vasopressors. Renal function monitored closely, transient AKI resolved with improved perfusion.  
- Day 4: Gradual improvement in volume status. Transitioned to oral diuretics. Initiated low-dose beta blockade.  
- Day 5: Impella weaned and explanted. Patient remains in ICU for monitoring.

**Assessment and Plan**  
**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (EF 15%)**  
- Etiology: Likely ischemic vs. nonischemic (coronary angiography pending)  
- Status post temporary percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for refractory shock, now improved  
- Continue guideline-directed medical therapy, up-titrate beta blocker and ACEi as tolerated  
- Daily weights, strict I/O, maintain euvolemia  
- Serial echo for LV function  
- Cardiac rehab consult  
- Monitor for arrhythmias, end-organ dysfunction  

**2. Hypertension**  
- Off home thiazide during acute renal injury, will resume as renal function normalizes  
- Monitor BP, titrate antihypertensive regimen  

**3. Hyperlipidemia**  
- Continue statin therapy  
- Lipids rechecked, at goal  

**4. Obesity, Prediabetes**  
- Nutrition consult, diabetic diet  
- Monitor glucose, A1c 6.0%  
- Encourage gradual weight loss post-discharge  

**5. Anemia**  
- Chronic, mild, multifactorial (anemia of chronic disease + iron deficiency); no transfusion required  
- Monitor hemoglobin, iron studies  
- Resume iron supplementation after ICU  

**6. Colon Cancer (remote, s/p colectomy), Polyps**  
- No evidence of recurrence on recent imaging  
- GI to follow outpatient, colonoscopy scheduled in 6 months  

**7. Sinusitis (chronic/viral)**  
- No evidence of acute infection during this admission  
- Supportive care only  

**8. AKI (transient, resolved)**  
- Likely pre-renal from shock, resolved with improved perfusion  
- Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins  

**9. Pain, Right Shoulder (rotator cuff injury, chronic)**  
- Acetaminophen PRN  
- Avoid NSAIDs due to renal/cardiac status  

**10. VTE Prophylaxis**  
- SCDs, low-dose heparin  

**11. Physical Deconditioning**  
- PT/OT evaluation, early mobilization as tolerated  

**12. Social/Disposition**  
- Discharge planning with case manager, likely SNF for rehab

- Monitor hemodynamics, volume status  
- Up-titrate HF meds  
- Arrange cardiac MRI if ischemic workup negative  
- Continue monitoring for infection, arrhythmia  
- Prepare for step-down transfer when stable

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity edema.

**HPI:**  
Ms. Lockman is a 102-year-old female with a history of chronic systolic heart failure (EF 38%), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and CKD stage 4 who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and abdominal discomfort. She reports a 3-kg weight gain over the past week, increased lower extremity swelling, decreased urine output, and mild confusion per her daughter.

She was admitted for acute on chronic decompensated heart failure with evidence of cardiogenic shock (SBP 82/54 mmHg, cool extremities, altered mentation). Initial labs notable for acute kidney injury on CKD, lactic acidosis, and elevated NT-proBNP. She was started on IV furosemide and dobutamine, but remained hypotensive and oliguric. A temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 2 for refractory cardiogenic shock.

**Hospital Course Summary:**  
- Hospital Day 1: Admitted to ICU. Started on IV diuretics, inotropes. Worsening end-organ perfusion.
- Hospital Day 2: Required temporary LVAD (Impella) placement due to persistent cardiogenic shock.  
- Hospital Days 3-7: Gradual improvement in perfusion, weaned off inotropes. Renal function slowly improved, but still requiring intermittent hemodialysis.  
- Hospital Day 8: Impella removed. Transitioned to oral heart failure regimen, slow uptitration of diuretics.  
- Hospital Days 9-11: Continued diuresis, mental status improved. Persistent mild hyperglycemia, ongoing management of hypertension, diabetes, and CKD.

**Assessment and Plan:**  

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure (EF 38%)**  
- Required temporary LVAD (Impella) placement for refractory shock  
- Weaned off inotropes, Impella removed HD 8  
- Continue guideline-directed medical therapy: metoprolol succinate, ACE-I/ARB, spironolactone, uptitrate as tolerated  
- Monitor for arrhythmias, daily weights, strict I/O  
- Cardiology to follow  

**2. Acute Kidney Injury on CKD 4**  
- Likely secondary to low cardiac output, hypotension  
- Intermittent hemodialysis x3, now improving off RRT  
- Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins  
- Nephrology to follow  

**3. Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus Type 2**  
- Persistent fasting BG 102-117, A1c 5.5%  
- Restart metformin, monitor for lactic acidosis  
- Endocrine to assist with glycemic control  

**4. Hypertension**  
- Initially labile, now improved after diuresis  
- Continue home regimen: amlodipine/hctz/olmesartan, monitor BP  
- Hold ACEi if renal function worsens  

**5. Obesity/Metabolic Syndrome**  
- Counsel on low-salt, low-carb diet  
- PT/OT to assist with mobility, encourage weight loss  

**6. Chronic Sinusitis, Viral URI**  
- Supportive care, saline nasal spray, acetaminophen PRN  
- No evidence of superimposed bacterial infection  

**7. Pain (chronic back, ankle sprain)**  
- Acetaminophen PRN, minimize opioids  
- Re-evaluate pain regimen prior to discharge  

**8. Disposition/Social**  
- Daughter at bedside, lives at home with family  
- Discharge planning with care coordinator, probable SNF placement

**Patient:** Hayes, Alina  
**MRN:** 00983422  
**DOB:** 11/24/1964 (Age: 59)  
**Sex:** Female  
**Attending:** Dr. Samuel Kline, MD  
**Date of Admission:** 2024-05-30  
**Date/Time of Note:** 2024-06-03 09:44  
**Location:** Cardiac ICU, 6E

### Chief Complaint
Shortness of breath and acute-on-chronic lower extremity edema.

---

### HPI
Alina Hayes is a 59-year-old female with a history of obesity, hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis, and recurrent urinary tract infections who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and new-onset confusion. She reported a dry cough and malaise for 1 week prior, and was recently treated for a UTI with nitrofurantoin. She denied chest pain. In the ED, she was found to be hypotensive (SBP 82 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 112), and hypoxic (SpO2 88% on RA). Initial labs revealed elevated troponin, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. Bedside echo showed severely reduced LVEF (EF 15%), and she was admitted to the ICU for management of presumed cardiogenic shock. Due to persistent shock despite inotropes, a left-sided Impella CP device was placed on hospital day 1.

### Imaging

- **Echo (5/30/24):** Severe global hypokinesis, LVEF 15%, moderate MR, RV function mildly reduced.
- **CXR (5/30/24):** Bilateral pulmonary edema, mild cardiomegaly, Impella device in place.

---

### Assessment and Plan (Problem-Based)

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (Acute Systolic Heart Failure, likely ischemic)**
   - Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support.
   - Weaning inotropes (dobutamine, norepinephrine).
   - Diuresis ongoing.
   - Repeat echo pending for recovery assessment.
   - Monitor for arrhythmias, hemolysis, device-related complications.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (likely multifactorial)**
   - Likely secondary to hypoperfusion, possible nephrotoxicity from antibiotics.
   - Renal function improving with improved hemodynamics.
   - Monitor daily chemistries, avoid nephrotoxins.

**3. Sepsis Rule-out**
   - Initial concern due to shock and leukocytosis.
   - Blood/urine cultures negative to date.
   - Broad-spectrum antibiotics de-escalated.

**4. Hypothyroidism**
   - Continue home levothyroxine; TSH mildly elevated, free T4 low-normal.
   - Monitor as stress can alter thyroid labs.

**5. Obesity**
   - Address during rehab phase; monitor caloric intake, consider nutrition consult.

**6. Recurrent UTIs**
   - On nitrofurantoin prophylaxis.
   - Urine culture negative during admission.

**7. Osteoarthritis, Knees**
   - Naproxen held due to AKI.
   - Acetaminophen for pain.

**8. Delirium/Encephalopathy**
   - Improving with hemodynamics.
   - Reorient frequently, minimize sedation.

**9. Volume Overload**
   - Ongoing IV diuresis.
   - Daily weights, strict I/O monitoring.

**10. DVT Prophylaxis**
    - SCDs in place; consider heparin if bleeding risk acceptable.

### Dispo/Follow-Up

- Remain in ICU for continued monitoring and Impella wean
- Cardiology and nephrology following
- Plan for stepdown when hemodynamically stable off device
- PT/OT to evaluate for functional baseline prior to discharge

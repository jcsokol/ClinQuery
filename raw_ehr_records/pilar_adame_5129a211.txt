# ICU Progress Note

---

## CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest pressure x 3 days

---

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
50-year-old female with PMH of prediabetes, anemia, chronic intractable migraine, recurrent sinusitis, and remote left ankle fracture, who presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and substernal chest pressure. She initially thought her symptoms were related to a recent viral illness but became increasingly short of breath at rest and had one episode of lightheadedness and near-syncope at home.  

In the ED, she was noted to be tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic. Initial labs showed elevated troponin and BNP, and CXR revealed pulmonary vascular congestion. Bedside echo showed severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, and moderate MR. She was admitted to the ICU for management of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and possible cardiogenic shock.  

She was started on inotropes and vasopressors but remained persistently hypotensive. A decision was made to place a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support, which was placed without complication on HD2. She has since been weaned off vasopressors but remains volume overloaded.

## HOSPITAL COURSE (HD1-HD7)
- HD1: Admission, started on dobutamine, norepinephrine. Severe ADHF with suspected viral myocarditis.  
- HD2: Worsening shock, Impella CP placed. Labs: rising creatinine, lactate. Cardiac markers peaked.  
- HD3: Vasopressors weaned, improved mentation, urine output up.  
- HD4: Diuresis with IV furosemide, volume status improved.  
- HD5: Impella flows weaned, echo improved (LVEF ~30%).  
- HD6: Impella explanted, transitioned to oral heart failure regimen.  
- HD7: Remains stable, planning step-down transfer.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF)
- Initial presentation with severe decompensated HF, likely viral myocarditis (recent URI), new severely reduced LVEF.
- Required inotropes and vasopressors.
- Impella CP placed on HD2 for hemodynamic support.
- Now weaned off Impella and vasoactive meds, improving.
- Plan: Continue HF regimen (metoprolol, low-dose ACEi, spironolactone). Monitor volume status. Repeat echo in 1 week. Cardiac MRI pending.

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
- Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, diuretic use, contrast exposure.
- Improved with restoration of perfusion and diuresis.
- Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal dosing.

### 3. Anemia
- Mild normocytic anemia, stable, no evidence of acute blood loss.
- Plan: Monitor CBC, iron studies outpatient, consider EPO if persistent.

### 4. Volume Overload
- Managed with diuresis (IV furosemide).
- Now euvolemic.
- Plan: Daily weights, strict I/Os, adjust diuretics as needed.

### 5. History of Perennial Allergic Rhinitis / Sinusitis
- No acute infectious symptoms currently.
- Plan: Resume fluticasone/asthma regimen as tolerated.

### 6. Chronic Migraine
- No headaches during ICU stay.
- Plan: Continue home meds, PRN acetaminophen.

### 7. Prediabetes
- Glucose well controlled in hospital.
- Plan: Resume home diet, monitor A1c outpatient.

### 8. Remote Fracture, Pyelonephritis
- No acute issues.

---

## DISPOSITION
- Step-down unit once stable for 24h off vasoactive support.
- Cardiology, heart failure, and nephrology following.
- Outpatient follow-up with primary care, cardiology, nephrology.

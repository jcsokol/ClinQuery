### Chief Complaint  
"Shortness of breath, chest pressure, and cough."

### HPI  
39-year-old male with PMH notable for hyperlipidemia and recent viral sinusitis and acute bronchitis who presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive SOB, orthopnea, and worsening cough. He reported subjective fevers, chills, and myalgias. In the ED, he was noted to be tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic (SpO2 88% on RA). Given concern for acute decompensated heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and possible viral myocarditis, he was transferred to the MICU. During hospitalization, the patient developed worsening hemodynamic instability and pulmonary edema refractory to medical therapy. A temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed for circulatory support.

### Problem List / Assessment & Plan

#### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Acute Fulminant Myocarditis**
- **Assessment:**  
  Presentation, echocardiogram (EF 15%), and cardiac MRI consistent with severe LV dysfunction, likely viral in etiology (recent URI). Emergent Impella CP placed on HD#2 due to persistent hypotension and rising lactate.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue Impella support, daily weaning trials as tolerated  
  - Vasopressors (norepinephrine off as of HD#4)  
  - Serial TTEs  
  - Cardiac enzymes q6h  
  - Monitor for hemolysis (LDH, haptoglobin, plasma free Hgb)  
  - Consider transfer to advanced HF/transplant center if no recovery by HD#7  
  - Restrict fluids, daily weights  

#### 2. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
- **Assessment:**  
  Multifactorial: pulmonary edema (cardiogenic) and superimposed bronchitis. Intubated for airway protection on HD#1, extubated HD#4.  
- **Plan:**  
  - High-flow nasal cannula, titrate to SpO2 >92%  
  - Diuresis with furosemide drip  
  - Daily CXR  
  - Incentive spirometry  
  - Pulmonary toilet  

#### 3. **Viral Sinusitis & Acute Bronchitis**
- **Assessment:**  
  Recent URI symptoms, RSV PCR positive, negative for influenza/COVID.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Supportive care  
  - Acetaminophen for fever  
  - Monitor for secondary bacterial infection  
  - ENT consult if sinus symptoms worsen  

#### 4. **Acute Kidney Injury (likely pre-renal)**
- **Assessment:**  
  Rising creatinine to 2.1 (baseline 1.0) on HD#2, likely secondary to low cardiac output. Improved with hemodynamic support.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor UOP q1h  
  - Avoid nephrotoxins  
  - Renal dosing of meds  
  - Renal consult if no improvement  

#### 5. **Hyperlipidemia**
- **Assessment:**  
  Known, not contributing to present illness.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Hold statins during acute illness  
  - Resume at discharge  

#### 6. **Pain (mild, myalgias and chest discomfort)**
- **Assessment:**  
  Likely viral/myocardial.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Acetaminophen PRN  
  - Reassess daily  

#### 7. **Nutrition**
- **Assessment:**  
  NPO x24h post-intubation, now on cardiac diet.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Advance as tolerated  
  - Nutritionist consult

### Chief Complaint
Acute onset dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest discomfort.

---

### History of Present Illness
49-year-old female with past medical history significant for perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis, recurrent viral sinusitis, history of multiple pregnancies and a first trimester miscarriage, who presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and chest heaviness. On arrival, she was hypoxic, tachycardic, and hypotensive. Rapid bedside TTE revealed severely depressed LVEF (est 15%), global hypokinesis, and moderate MR. The patient decompensated with hypotension refractory to fluids and pressors, requiring intubation, vasopressors, and emergent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for presumed acute cardiogenic shock.

### ICU Hospital Course (Days 1–4)

**Day 1 (05/15/24):**  
- Presented in cardiogenic shock, intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  
- Labs: Elevated troponin I (0.94 ng/mL), BNP 2200 pg/mL, lactate 5.1 mmol/L.  
- CXR: Pulmonary edema  
- Echo: EF 15%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR  
- Emergent Impella CP placed via femoral approach.  
- Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine.  
- Foley, A-line, and central line placed.

**Day 2 (05/16/24):**  
- BP stabilized on Impella support, weaned off norepinephrine.  
- Extubated to BiPAP.  
- Cardiac workup: no significant CAD on cath.  
- Suspected viral myocarditis—resp viral panel pending.  
- Started on colchicine, high-dose steroids.  
- Renal function worsening (Cr 1.9 mg/dL from 1.1 baseline).

**Day 3 (05/17/24):**  
- Marked diuresis, decreasing pulmonary congestion.  
- Downtrending troponin and BNP.  
- Improved mental status, off BiPAP.  
- Impella flows weaned, hemodynamics stable.  
- Transaminitis noted (AST 122, ALT 140).

**Day 4 (05/18/24):**  
- Impella removed, stable off mechanical support.
- Monitoring for arrhythmias, no VT/VF noted.  
- Creatinine trending down to 1.5.  
- Transferred to stepdown unit.

### Problem List & Assessment/Plan

#### 1. Cardiogenic Shock (Resolved)
- Initially required Impella CP for hemodynamic support.
- Likely secondary to acute viral myocarditis (pending viral serologies).
- Now stable on oral afterload reduction (lisinopril, low-dose carvedilol).
- Continue daily weights, strict I/O, telemetry.

#### 2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure
- EF 15% on admission, improving clinically.
- Continue GDMT, monitor for recurrent symptoms.
- Repeat TTE planned prior to discharge.

#### 3. Acute Kidney Injury (resolving)
- Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic meds, diuretics.
- Renal function improving with hemodynamic stabilization.
- Monitor BMP, avoid nephrotoxins.

#### 4. Transaminitis
- Mild elevation in AST/ALT, likely ischemic hepatitis vs. drug-induced.
- Downtrending, monitor daily LFTs.

#### 5. Recurrent Sinusitis/Allergic Rhinitis
- No active infection.
- Resume home allergy medications as tolerated.

#### 6. Contraceptive Management
- Mirena IUD confirmed in place.
- No estrogen-containing contraceptives recommended due to new cardiomyopathy.

#### 7. Nutrition
- Started on cardiac diet.

#### 8. VTE Prophylaxis
- SQ heparin.

#### 9. Psychosocial
- Supportive counseling provided.
- Social work consult for discharge planning.

Mr. Germán Aguirre is a 111-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease s/p PCI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prediabetes, chronic anemia, and prostate neoplasm (on chemotherapy and leuprolide), who presented to the ED 8 days ago with acute worsening of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest discomfort. He was found to be hypotensive (SBP 78), tachycardic, and hypoxic (O2 sat 85% RA). Initial labs and imaging were concerning for acute decompensated heart failure and possible cardiogenic shock. He was admitted to the ICU, started on inotropic support, and subsequently underwent placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for refractory cardiogenic shock.

- Prostate neoplasm (on docetaxel and leuprolide)
- Carcinoma in situ of prostate
- Acute bronchitis (resolved)
- Prior laceration of thigh (healed)
- First degree burn (remote, healed)

Surgical History:
- PCI x2 (2011, 2018)

IMAGING & PROCEDURES

6/6/2024: CXR - Pulmonary edema, small bilateral effusions.
6/6/2024: TTE - LVEF 20%, severe global hypokinesis, mild MR/TR.
6/7/2024: Left heart cath - no acute occlusion, severe CAD, Impella CP placed.
6/10/2024: TTE - LVEF 25%, mild MR, IVC <2cm, no pericardial effusion.

===============================================================================
ASSESSMENT & PLAN

1. Cardiogenic Shock, acute on chronic HFrEF (EF 20-25%), s/p Impella CP
   - Etiology: likely ischemic, severe CAD, underlying chronic LV dysfunction.
   - Impella CP placed for refractory shock, removed after 5 days with hemodynamic improvement.
   - On GDMT: metoprolol, spironolactone, furosemide, ACEi held for AKI.
   - Monitor volume status, renal function, and for arrhythmias.
   - Cardiology to follow. Consider advanced therapies if recurrent decompensation.

2. Chronic Coronary Artery Disease
   - Continue DAPT (clopidogrel), high-intensity statin.
   - Monitor for recurrent ischemia.
   - No PCI indicated, no acute occlusion on cath.

3. Anemia, multifactorial (chronic disease, chemo, acute blood loss)
   - Transfused 3U PRBC during admission.
   - Monitor for GI bleed, hemolysis (post-Impella).
   - Outpatient GI workup (if recurrent).
   - Epoetin not indicated at this time.

4. AKI, resolving (peak Cr 1.7, now 0.8)
   - Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, diuresis, hemolysis.
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents.
   - Monitor UOP, lytes, daily labs.

5. Prostate cancer, s/p chemo, on leuprolide
   - Oncology consulted, docetaxel held.
   - Resume after recovery from acute illness.
   - Continue leuprolide.

6. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prediabetes
   - BP controlled off vasopressors, on oral regimen.
   - Continue simvastatin, amlodipine, atenolol/chlorthalidone.
   - Monitor for statin-related myopathy.
   - Encourage lifestyle modification, monitor A1c.

7. Delirium, ICU-related
   - Improved with sleep-wake cycle restoration, PT/OT, reorientation.
   - No antipsychotics required.

8. Wound care: old thigh laceration, 1st degree burn (healed)
   - No evidence of infection, wound closed.
   - Daily skin checks.

9. DVT prophylaxis
   - SQ heparin while inpatient, SCDs.

10. Discharge planning
   - Anticipate transfer to telemetry, then home with daughter.
   - Arrange for outpatient HF, oncology, and PCP follow-up.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
24-year-old male with past medical history significant for recurrent sinusitis, bronchitis, recent concussion (3 months ago), and remote left rotator cuff injury, presenting to the ED with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and an episode of syncope at home. Family reports he had a viral URI 10 days prior, followed by worsening fatigue, PND, and mild non-productive cough. In the ED found to be hypotensive (BP 82/54), tachycardic (HR 123), tachypneic (RR 28), and hypoxic (SpO2 89% RA). Exam notable for JVD, S3, bibasilar crackles, and cool extremities.

Initial labs and bedside echo concerning for severe global LV dysfunction (EF 15%), elevated troponin, and lactic acidosis. Admitted to ICU for management of cardiogenic shock. Required vasopressor support and was emergently placed on a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) due to refractory shock.

- Monitored for arrhythmias; brief NSVT, self-limited.

### ICU DAY 3-4:
- Weaned off vasopressors.

- Negative infectious workup; antibiotics discontinued.
- Mental status improved; extubated on Day 4.

### ICU DAY 5-7:
- Continued recovery of cardiac function (EF 35%).
- Impella removed on Day 6; hemodynamics stable.
- Transitioned to oral heart failure regimen (metoprolol, lisinopril).
- CK, troponin, and BNP trending down.
- Repeat echo: mild LV dilation, EF 37%.

     - Monitor for arrhythmias
     - Daily weights, strict I/O
     - Repeat echo outpatient in 2 weeks
     - Cardiology f/u

### 2. **Impella Device (Temporary LVAD)**
   - Placed for refractory cardiogenic shock, removed after 5 days
   - Plan:
     - Site care, monitor for access complications (bleeding, infection, limb ischemia)
     - DVT prophylaxis until ambulation
     - Monitor Hgb, renal function

### 3. **Non-oliguric AKI (resolved)**
   - Likely multifactorial (cardiorenal, hypoperfusion, nephrotoxins)
   - Plan:
     - Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins
     - Hydration as tolerated

### 4. **Transaminitis (resolved)**
   - Likely shock liver
   - Plan:
     - Monitor LFTs, expect normalization

### 5. **Arrhythmia (NSVT, resolved)**
   - Plan:
     - Continue telemetry
     - Hold antiarrhythmics unless recurrence

### 6. **Concussion (remote)**
   - No acute findings
   - Plan: No restrictions

### 7. **Chronic/Acute Sinusitis, Acute Bronchitis**
   - Treated as secondary to viral illness, no current symptoms
   - Plan: Supportive care

### 8. **Remote Rotator Cuff Injury**
   - No acute issues
   - Plan: Resume PT as tolerated

### 9. **VTE Prophylaxis**
   - Plan: SCDs, LMWH until ambulatory

### 10. **Nutrition/Rehabilitation**
   - High-calorie, low sodium, cardiac diet
   - PT/OT

---

## DISCHARGE PLANNING
- Anticipate discharge to home with close follow-up
- Home health RN for wound checks
- Cardiology, PCP, and PT/OT follow-up

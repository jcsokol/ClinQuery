### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Shortness of breath, orthopnea, chest tightness.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Mr. Gerald Walsh is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history including severe obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus with neuropathy, chronic sinusitis and viral sinusitis, chronic obstructive bronchitis (COPD), anemia, hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic syndrome, and recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis. He presented to the ED with progressive dyspnea, new-onset orthopnea, and chest discomfort over 3 days. He denied fevers, cough, or recent sick contacts. His home medications include vitamin B12, fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler, prednisone, and penicillin (recently for strep throat).

On arrival, he was tachypneic, hypertensive (BP 162/98), tachycardic (HR 109), and hypoxic (SpO2 88% on RA). Initial labs revealed hyperglycemia, mild AKI, and a troponin elevation. CXR showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. He rapidly developed hypotension (SBP < 90), refractory hypoxemia, and signs of low cardiac output despite diuresis and noninvasive ventilation. Echo showed severely reduced LVEF (15%), global hypokinesis, and moderate MR. He was admitted to the ICU for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) with cardiogenic shock, requiring escalating vasopressors and inotropes.

Due to worsening end-organ hypoperfusion and persistent shock, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 2 for temporary mechanical circulatory support.

## ICU ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic shock s/p Impella CP placement (HD#2)**
   - ADHF on chronic metabolic syndrome, DM, and obesity background.
   - Initial presentation with hypotension, end-organ hypoperfusion, rising lactate, and persistent low-output state.
   - Impella CP placed for temporary LV support, with rapid improvement in MAP and urine output.
   - Vasopressors/inotropes weaned off by HD#4.  
   - Daily echo for Impella positioning; device removed HD#5 after hemodynamic stability.
   - Continue close monitoring, goal-directed therapy.
   - Plan: Optimize HF meds as tolerated, start gentle diuresis, consider SGLT2i when stable.

### 2. **Acute decompensated heart failure (HFrEF, likely ischemic)**
   - BNP peaked at 4,040, CXR with pulmonary edema, echo with low LVEF.
   - Diuresed with IV furosemide, transitioned to PO HD#6.
   - Fluid status: euvolemic post-diuresis, weight down 4.8 kg.
   - Plan: Continue diuretics, low-salt diet, up-titrate GDMT as tolerated (BB, ACEi/ARB, MRA).

### 3. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus (with neuropathy)**
   - Hyperglycemia with stress/infection, glucose peaked at 201.
   - Insulin sliding scale in ICU, now on basal-bolus regimen.
   - A1c 6.9% on admission.
   - Plan: Endo consult, continue tight glycemic control, foot checks.

### 4. **Chronic obstructive bronchitis**
   - Baseline FEV1/FVC 49%.
   - COPD exacerbation ruled out (no wheezing, no increased secretions).
   - Continue home inhalers, monitor for secondary infections.
   - Plan: Pulm f/u, consider PFTs as outpatient.

### 5. **Anemia (multifactorial)**
   - Hgb dropped from 13.7 to 10.4 (nadir) during ICU stay, now stable.
   - Normocytic, consistent with chronic disease/renal and heart failure; no overt bleeding.
   - Plan: Monitor, iron studies pending, consider EPO if CKD progresses.

### 6. **Obesity/metabolic syndrome**
   - BMI at admission 30+; weight loss during hospitalization.
   - Hypertriglyceridemia, LDL elevated.
   - Plan: Cardio diet consult, statin therapy, consider GLP-1 agonist outpatient.

### 7. **Recent streptococcal pharyngitis, chronic sinusitis**
   - Completed penicillin course prior to admission.
   - No evidence of ongoing infection.
   - Plan: Monitor, ENT follow-up as outpatient.

### 8. **Acute kidney injury (resolved)**
   - Creatinine peaked at 1.67, now <1.0.
   - Likely prerenal from low cardiac output, improved with MCS/diuresis.
   - Plan: Monitor, avoid nephrotoxins.

### 9. **Other**
   - DVT prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin SQ.
   - Stress ulcer prophylaxis: pantoprazole.
   - VTE screen negative.
   - PT/OT: Mobilizing with assistance, mild neuropathy persists.
   - Vaccines: UTD.

---

### DISPOSITION
- Remains in ICU, planned transfer to step-down in 1-2 days.
- Cardiac rehab, close HF follow-up.
- Prognosis guarded but improved.

### CHIEF COMPLAINT
"Worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue"  

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Mr. Flatley is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension, prediabetes, anemia, chronic coronary heart disease, and COPD, who presented to the ED with subacute worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and intermittent chest pain over 1 week. He was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with evidence of cardiogenic shock (SBP 77/50 on arrival, cold extremities, altered mentation). Despite initial stabilization with IV diuretics, dobutamine, and vasopressors, he developed persistent hypotension and rising lactate, prompting the placement of a percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) on HD2 for hemodynamic support.  

Course complicated by AKI, anemia, and intermittent fevers. Now on HD8, he remains on LVAD support with weaning of vasopressors, stable renal function, and gradual respiratory improvement.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF)**
- Hx of CAD, HTN, recent viral syndrome; presented w/ ADHF, shock, multi-organ hypoperfusion.
- Required percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) HD2 for refractory shock.
- Now stable on LVAD, weaning off dobutamine. Vasopressors off since HD6.
- **Plan:**  
    - Continue LVAD, daily device checks.
    - Continue gentle diuresis, monitor weight, I/Os.
    - Wean inotropes as tolerated.
    - Serial echocardiogram (repeat HD10).
    - Daily BNP, lactate, renal function.
    - Cardiac rehab consult.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), likely prerenal**
- Creatinine peaked at 2.1, improved to 1.2; urine output adequate.
- **Plan:**  
    - Maintain MAP >65, avoid nephrotoxins.
    - Monitor lytes, daily renal panel.
    - Nephrology consult.

**3. Anemia, multifactorial (chronic + acute blood loss)**
- Hgb dropped to 10.1 after Impella placement, transfused 2U PRBCs HD3, now stable.
- **Plan:**  
    - Monitor serial CBCs.
    - Iron studies, B12/folate pending.
    - GI consult if persistent drop.

**4. COPD (Chronic Bronchitis phenotype)**
- Baseline FEV1/FVC 61%. Mild hypoxia on admit, now weaned off O2.
- **Plan:**  
    - Incentive spirometry, chest physiotherapy.
    - Hold inhaled steroids while intubated.
    - Resume home inhalers prior to transfer.

**5. Hypertension / Prediabetes**
- Off home antihypertensives during shock, now reintroducing as tolerated.
- Glucose well controlled.
- **Plan:**  
    - Reinitiate amlodipine, HCTZ as BP tolerates.
    - Monitor daily FS glucose.

**6. Infection Risk / Fever**
- Intermittent fevers, negative cultures, improved off antibiotics.
- **Plan:**  
    - Monitor for infection, daily CBC, cultures if temp >38.3°C.
    - Remove lines/catheters ASAP.

**7. Hyperlipidemia**
- On statin, continue.

**8. DVT Prophylaxis**
- On heparin drip for LVAD, continue.

**9. Nutrition / GI**
- NPO x1 day, now on low-salt cardiac diet, tolerating PO.

**10. Disposition / Rehab**
- Not candidate for transfer from ICU until off LVAD.
- Early PT/OT.

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Mr. Vaughn Gulgowski is a 33-year-old male with a history of DM2, HTN, hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic syndrome, who presented with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, pleuritic chest pain, and fevers. He was initially admitted for presumed viral pharyngitis but rapidly deteriorated on hospital day 1 with hypotension, hypoxemia, and evidence of cardiogenic shock. TTE revealed severely depressed LVEF (EF 18%). He was transferred to the ICU and ultimately required placement of a temporary left-sided heart pump (Impella CP) for circulatory support.

## IMAGING

- **CXR (3/14):** Pulmonary vascular congestion, mild bilateral effusions, Impella catheter tip projects over LV
- **TTE (3/14):** LVEF 18%, LV dilated, global hypokinesis, RV mild-moderate dysfunction, no valvular vegetations

---

## PROCEDURES

- 3/14: Central line (R IJ), arterial line (R radial)
- 3/15: Impella CP placement (L femoral, under fluoro), bedside echo confirmation
- 3/15: Endotracheal intubation for acute hypoxemic resp failure

---

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, secondary to fulminant viral myocarditis**  
- Required vasoactive support (norepinephrine, weaned off by HD #4)
- Impella CP placed for LV unloading and end-organ perfusion, weaned and removed HD #5
- Serial TTEs for LV recovery (EF improved to 34% by HD #6)
- Daily troponin trending, lactate clearance
- Strict I/Os, daily weights
- Monitor for hemolysis, vascular complications

**2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure**  
- Intubated for respiratory distress, ARDSnet vent settings
- Extubated HD #5, transitioned to 2L NC
- CXR monitoring, daily ABGs

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, multifactorial)**  
- Likely due to low cardiac output and hypoperfusion
- Held nephrotoxins, avoided contrast
- Monitored UOP, Cr trended down with improved perfusion

**4. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2**  
- Insulin drip during critical illness, transitioned to basal/bolus on floor
- Restarted metformin once AKI resolved
- Endo consult for glycemic control

**5. Hypertension, Hypertriglyceridemia, Metabolic Syndrome**  
- Held HCTZ during AKI, reinitiated on discharge
- Restarted statin post-AKI
- Dietary consult for cardiac diet, low sodium, low fat

**6. Acute viral pharyngitis**  
- Supportive care, no antibiotics
- Negative strep/EBV/CMV, positive Coxsackie B IgM

**7. DVT Prophylaxis**  
- SCDs, SQ heparin

**8. Lines/Devices**  
- Daily assessment and care
- Central line removed HD #6, Impella removed HD #5

**9. Psychosocial**  
- SW, case management for discharge planning
- Family support, daily updates

---

## DISCHARGE PLAN (anticipated HD #8)

- Continue cardiac rehab, close cardiology follow-up
- Strict glycemic and BP control
- Outpatient echo in 2 weeks
- Home meds: resume metformin, HCTZ, atorvastatin, add carvedilol
- No driving for 1 month post-Impella
- Education on heart failure symptoms and when to seek care

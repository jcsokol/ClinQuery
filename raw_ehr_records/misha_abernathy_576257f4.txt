### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest pressure  

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Misha Abernathy is a 27-year-old female with a history of early-onset coronary heart disease (onset age 24), hyperlipidemia, and recent URI symptoms, who presented to the ED with 2 weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and intermittent chest discomfort. She reported a viral prodrome with cough, rhinorrhea, and sore throat 3 weeks prior, partially improved, but subsequently developed worsening fatigue, lower extremity edema, and shortness of breath at rest. Denied fever, hemoptysis, or syncope.

On arrival: tachypneic, hypoxic (SaO2 88% RA), tachycardic, BP 92/56 mmHg. CXR: pulmonary vascular congestion, mild interstitial edema. Troponin I 4.2 ng/mL, BNP 1450 pg/mL. ECG: sinus tach, nonspecific ST-T changes. Echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR, no tamponade. Emergent right heart cath: elevated PCWP, low CI (1.6), elevated SVR.

Transferred to CCU, started on dobutamine and nitroglycerin. Continued to deteriorate with progressive hypotension and rising lactate (peak 5.7 mmol/L), so Impella CP device placed for temporary circulatory support.

## PERTINENT IMAGING  
- **CXR (4/17/24):** Interstitial edema, mild pulmonary vascular congestion, no focal infiltrate.
- **TTE (4/17/24):** Severely reduced LVEF (15%), global hypokinesis, moderate MR, RV normal.
- **TTE (4/20/24):** LVEF improved to 28%, less MR, Impella visualized.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, likely viral myocarditis on top of CHD**
   - Admitted with acute decompensated heart failure, low-output shock.
   - Required inotropes and subsequently percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP).
   - Now improving: off inotropes, Impella weaning, LVEF improving.
   - **Plan:**  
     - Continue Impella wean, monitor for hemolysis/limb ischemia  
     - Strict I/Os, daily weights  
     - Goal-directed medical therapy for HF (ACEi/BB to be started if stable)  
     - Cardiac MRI after device removal for myocarditis assessment  
     - Telemetry for arrhythmias  
     - Consider cardiac biopsy if no further improvement

### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury, likely cardiorenal**
   - Uptrending creatinine, improved with volume management and improved perfusion
   - **Plan:**  
     - Monitor UOP, renal panel q12h  
     - Avoid nephrotoxins  
     - Renal consult if worsening

### 3. **Transaminitis**
   - Likely ischemic hepatitis from low-output state, improving
   - **Plan:**  
     - Monitor LFTs  
     - Hold statin for now  
     - Avoid hepatotoxins

### 4. **History of CAD, hyperlipidemia**
   - Likely exacerbated by myocarditis; no acute MI on imaging
   - **Plan:**  
     - Resume statin once LFTs normalize  
     - Continue clopidogrel  
     - Cardiac rehab referral

### 5. **Recent upper respiratory infection**
   - Viral prodrome, some concern for secondary bacterial infection
   - **Plan:**  
     - Respiratory viral PCR sent, negative for influenza/RSV/COVID  
     - No antibiotics unless new evidence of infection

### 6. **Gynecologic/OCP management**
   - OCPs held during acute illness; risk of thromboembolism with immobility
   - **Plan:**  
     - Discuss long-term contraception at follow-up  
     - DVT prophylaxis with heparin

### 7. **Other**
   - Pain: mild, managed with acetaminophen  
   - Nutrition: NPO for first 24h, then cardiac diet  
   - Physical therapy: consult placed for early mobilization  
   - Psychosocial: SW and psych consult for coping, anxiety

---

## DISPOSITION  
- Anticipate transfer to stepdown, then home with close follow-up in heart failure clinic.
- Will require close outpatient cardiac monitoring, repeat TTE, and consideration for ICD if EF remains <35%.

# HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**CC:** "Shortness of breath, chest pressure, dizziness, and confusion."

**HPI:**  
Daniella Mertz is a 66-year-old female with PMH significant for obesity, chronic sinusitis, hyperlipidemia, CKD stage III, remote colon polypectomy, and recurrent UTIs, who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and 1 day of new confusion. She was found to be hypotensive to the 70s/40s, tachycardic, and hypoxic. Initial labs revealed an acute kidney injury on CKD, elevated BNP, and troponin. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Echo revealed a severely depressed EF (15%) with global hypokinesis. She developed progressive shock refractory to high-dose vasopressors and inotropes, requiring intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. A temporary left-sided Impella CP device was placed for mechanical circulatory support on HD#2. She was managed in the MICU with gradual improvement, weaned off vasopressors by HD#5, and Impella explanted on HD#6. Renal function partially recovered, but the patient required diuresis for ongoing volume overload. Hospital course complicated by UTI, delirium, and persistent hyperlipidemia.

# ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (Acute on Chronic HFrEF):**
- Admitted in decompensated heart failure, likely ischemic etiology (elevated troponin, global hypokinesis).
- Required temporary MCS (Impella) for refractory shock.
- Weaned off pressors, transitioned to gentle diuresis.
- Continue GDMT (hold ACEi for now due to AKI), resume beta-blocker when stable.
- Cardiology to follow, consider coronary angiography after recovery.
- Daily weights, strict I/Os, monitor for recurrence of shock.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury on CKD III:**
- Likely multifactorial: low perfusion, contrast exposure, baseline CKD.
- Creat peaked at 4.2, now improved to 2.6, still above baseline (~1.8).
- Foley in place for accurate I/Os.
- Renal consult obtained, recommend avoidance of nephrotoxins, careful volume management.
- Monitor electrolytes, adjust meds for renal function.

**3. Respiratory Failure (Pulmonary Edema):**
- Intubated for hypoxic resp failure on HD#1, extubated HD#4.
- CXR improved, O2 sat stable on 2L NC.
- Diuresis ongoing.
- Incentive spirometry, pulmonary toilet.

**4. UTI (E. coli):**
- Positive urine cx on HD#2, started on IV ceftriaxone, then transitioned to oral nitrofurantoin after sensitivities.
- Completed 5-day course; f/u cultures negative.
- Foley care, monitor for recurrence.

**5. Obesity (BMI ~30):**
- Nutrition consult.
- Low sodium, low cholesterol diet.
- Encourage mobility as tolerated.

**6. Hyperlipidemia:**
- Home simvastatin resumed.
- Lipid panel repeated, no acute changes.
- Outpatient lipid clinic referral.

**7. Delirium:**
- Fluctuating attention, likely multifactorial (ICU, infection, metabolic).
- Reoriented frequently, sleep hygiene, minimize sedatives.
- Psychiatry consulted for support.

**8. Chronic Sinusitis, Hx Colon Polyps, Hx 1st Trimester Miscarriage:**
- No acute issues during admission.
- Routine follow-up as outpatient.

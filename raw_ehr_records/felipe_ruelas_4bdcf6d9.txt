## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

44-year-old male with hx of poorly controlled DM2, HTN, hypertriglyceridemia, CKD 1, and metabolic syndrome, presented to ED with 3 days of progressive SOB, orthopnea, and chest heaviness. Found to be hypertensive and tachypneic. In ED, developed hypotension and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring emergent intubation. Initial EKG: sinus tach, nonspecific ST changes. Troponin peaked at 4.6. Bedside echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR. Cardiology emergently consulted; patient developed cardiogenic shock and was started on norepinephrine and dobutamine. Despite escalating pressors and inotropes, MAP <60 mmHg and lactate 5.2 mmol/L. Decision made for placement of percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for temporary mechanical circulatory support.  

Hospital course complicated by AKI, worsening hyperglycemia, and superimposed bacterial pneumonia (see below).

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to acute decompensated heart failure**  
- Likely precipitated by viral illness (recent pharyngitis/sinusitis) on background of ischemic cardiomyopathy and metabolic syndrome.  
- Required mechanical circulatory support with percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP).  
- Now successfully weaned off Impella, hemodynamically stable off pressors/inotropes.  
- Plan: Continue aggressive diuresis, close hemodynamic monitoring, optimize GDMT, consider cardiac rehab.

**2. Acute on chronic kidney injury (CKD 1)**
- Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic exposure, possible ATN.
- Improved with volume management and renal perfusion post-Impella.
- Cr trending down, eGFR improving.
- Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal dosing.

**3. Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2)**
- Marked hyperglycemia during critical illness, now improving.
- Insulin drip transitioned to SQ sliding scale.
- Plan: Endo to follow, dietary consult, target BG <180.

**4. Superimposed hospital-acquired pneumonia**
- Fever, new infiltrate, positive sputum culture for GNR.
- Improved on pip-tazo, afebrile, WBC normalizing.
- Plan: Continue abx to complete course, monitor for complications.

**5. Hypertension, Metabolic Syndrome, Hypertriglyceridemia**
- BP now at goal on current regimen.
- Plan: Reinforce medication compliance, low-salt/low-fat diet, outpatient lipid clinic referral.

**6. Diabetic Renal Disease**
- See above; monitor for proteinuria, optimize glycemic and BP control.

**7. Deconditioning**
- Mobilizing with PT/OT.
- Plan: Early rehab, DVT prophylaxis.

**8. Discharge Planning**
- To acute rehab vs home with PT, home health.
- Arrange close outpatient f/u: Cardiology, Nephrology, Endocrinology.

### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Progressive SOB, chest heaviness, and confusion.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Star Kulas is a 70-year-old female with a past medical history significant for non-small cell lung cancer (s/p multiple cycles of cisplatin/paclitaxel), chronic and acute sinusitis, obesity (BMI ~30), anemia, and recent diagnosis of Stage I NSCLC, who presented to the ED three days ago with acute onset dyspnea, orthopnea, and progressive confusion. She was found hypoxic (SpO₂ 86% RA) and tachypneic. On arrival, she was hypotensive (BP 78/48), with JVD, cool extremities, and bibasilar crackles. Initial labs were notable for AKI (Cr 3.4 mg/dL), anemia (Hb 11.3), and elevated BNP. CXR: Large right lower lobe mass, pulmonary edema.

She rapidly deteriorated with evidence of cardiogenic shock (SBP <80 mmHg, MAP <60, lactate 5.8), requiring norepinephrine and dobutamine. TTE: Severely reduced LVEF (~18%), global hypokinesis, no tamponade, moderate MR. Cardiology consulted; presumed acute decompensated heart failure (likely chemo-induced, ischemic, or malignant infiltration). Due to persistent shock refractory to pressors, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 1. She was transferred to MICU for further management.

---

### HOSPITAL COURSE (to date)
- **Day 1:** Admitted to MICU. Required high-flow O₂, started on vasopressors/inotropes. Impella CP placed for cardiogenic shock. Chemotherapy held. Nephrology consulted for AKI.
- **Day 2:** Gradual improvement in MAP, weaned off norepinephrine. Oliguria persists. Labs: persistent AKI, mild transaminitis. Developed fever (Tmax 38.7°C), blood cultures sent, empiric vanc/cefepime started.
- **Day 3:** Improved mentation, still on Impella support. Extubated to HFNC. Vasopressors off. AKI improving. Echo: LVEF up to 30%. Oncology consulted; chemo on hold pending cardiac recovery.
- **Day 4:** Impella weaned, device removed. Stable hemodynamics. O₂ sat 95% on 2L NC. Monitoring for arrhythmias. Renal function continues to recover.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, s/p temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placement**
   - Likely multifactorial (chemo-induced cardiomyopathy vs. ischemic vs. malignant infiltration)
   - Impella placed day 1; now weaned and removed
   - MAP stable, off pressors/inotropes
   - Monitoring for arrhythmias, daily EKG
   - Cardiology f/u, consider GDMT for HF as tolerated
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os, diuresis as able

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (stage 3, now improving)**
   - Likely cardiorenal, possibly nephrotoxic from chemo
   - Nephrology following; Cr trending down
   - IVF held, careful fluid balance
   - Monitor lytes, daily chem7

**3. Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage I, RLL)**
   - s/p multiple cycles cisplatin/paclitaxel (on hold)
   - Oncology consulted, resume chemo after cardiac recovery
   - Imaging pending for restaging

**4. Anemia (chronic, multifactorial)**
   - Hb stable (10–11)
   - Monitor for GI bleed, transfuse if <7 or symptomatic
   - Iron studies pending

**5. Acute on Chronic Sinusitis, Bronchitis**
   - Treated with amox/clav, clinical improvement
   - Monitor for secondary infection

**6. Obesity (BMI 30)**
   - DVT ppx with SCDs, LMWH held due to AKI

**7. Infection/Sepsis rule out**
   - Febrile on day 2, blood cultures sent, empiric vanc/cefepime
   - No obvious source, abx to narrow if cultures negative

**8. Pain/Delirium**
   - Moderate pain, managed with acetaminophen
   - Delirium improved with metabolic correction

**9. Nutrition**
   - NPO initially, now on cardiac diet, PO intake improving

**10. Disposition**
   - Remain in MICU for monitoring, anticipate transfer to telemetry in 24–48h if stable

---

**To Do:**  
- Continue telemetry
- Daily labs: CBC, chem7, LFTs
- Monitor for arrhythmia, recurrent shock
- Cardiology, nephrology, oncology continue to follow
- Physical therapy to evaluate
- Discuss advanced directives/goals of care

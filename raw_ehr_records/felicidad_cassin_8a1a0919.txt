### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Felicidad Cassin is a 74-year-old woman with PMHx of morbid obesity (BMI 44), osteoarthritis of the hands, chronic sinusitis, recurrent bronchitis, and iron-deficiency anemia (on ferrous sulfate), who presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening dyspnea, productive cough, and new onset paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She reported a 7 lb weight gain over 1 week, decreased exercise tolerance, and difficulty sleeping flat. Family notes increased confusion and lethargy.

In the ED, she was tachypneic, hypoxic (SpO2 88% RA), hypertensive (BP 181/94), tachycardic (HR 122), with JVD, rales at both lung bases, 2+ pitting edema up to knees. CXR showed pulmonary edema; BNP 2350, troponin I 0.06 (peak 0.13), EKG with NSR and LVH. Echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR, dilated LV. She was admitted to MICU for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), likely ischemic, and possible cardiogenic shock.

Despite diuresis and IV vasodilators, she developed worsening hypotension, oliguria, rising lactate, and evidence of end-organ dysfunction. Cardiology placed a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on HD#2 for hemodynamic support. She was transferred to the ICU for ongoing management.

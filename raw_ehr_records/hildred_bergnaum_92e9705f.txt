# HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

96-year-old female with past medical history significant for seizure disorder, epilepsy, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), obesity, chronic pain, osteoarthritis of hip, recent forearm fracture, and polyp of colon, admitted from home after syncopal episode and progressive dyspnea. She developed acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock on hospital day 2, requiring transfer to the cardiac ICU and placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for temporary mechanical circulatory support. 

She also has chronic pain (on multiple pain medications), obesity, and a history of falls. Hospital course complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI), mild transaminitis, and delirium.

# CHIEF COMPLAINT
"Shortness of breath, swelling in legs, confusion" (per family, patient baseline mild dementia)

---

# HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Hildred Bergnaum is a 96-year-old woman with chronic systolic CHF (EF ~49%), seizure disorder (on carbamazepine), osteoarthritis, and obesity, who presented after a syncopal episode at home with several days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Family reports decreased oral intake and confusion. On arrival to ED, she was tachypneic, hypoxic (O2 sat 88% RA), hypertensive (BP 170/92), and had evidence of volume overload. Initial labs notable for elevated NT-proBNP, mild AKI, and elevated LFTs. 

On hospital day 2, she developed hypotension (MAP ~58), worsening hypoxia, and altered mental status. Bedside echocardiogram revealed severely reduced LV function (EF now 22%), moderate MR, and RV dysfunction. She was transferred to the ICU, started on inotropes (dobutamine) and vasopressors. Due to persistent cardiogenic shock, Impella CP was placed via femoral access. Over ensuing days, diuresis achieved, inotropes weaned, and renal function improved. Device was explanted on day 6 after hemodynamic stabilization.

# ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure (EF dropped to 22%)**  
- Transient severe decompensation with hypotension, multi-organ hypoperfusion.  
- Impella CP placed day 2, explanted day 6 after hemodynamic improvement.  
- On guideline-directed medical therapy (metoprolol, furosemide, ACEi held due to AKI).  
- Now off inotropes/pressors, stable on low-dose Lasix, euvolemic.  
- Echo: EF improved to 38% post-Impella, moderate MR, mild RV dysfunction persists.  
- Continue aggressive diuresis, up-titrate GDMT as tolerated, daily weights, strict I/Os.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (Stage 2, likely cardiorenal)**  
- Baseline Cr 0.5, peaked at 1.4 on ICU day 3, now improved to 0.7.  
- Monitored UOP, avoided nephrotoxins, adjusted diuretics accordingly.  
- Renal function improved with volume management.

**3. Acute Delirium**  
- Likely multifactorial: CHF, hypoperfusion, ICU stay, infection ruled out.  
- Monitored with CAM-ICU, reoriented, minimized sedation.  
- Now improved, back at baseline per daughter.

**4. Chronic Pain, Osteoarthritis, Recent Forearm Fracture**  
- On opioids, acetaminophen, naproxen (held during AKI).  
- Pain controlled, fracture splinted, ortho consulted (no acute intervention needed).  
- Continue PT/OT, minimize opioids.

**5. Seizure Disorder/Epilepsy**  
- Remained on carbamazepine, levels monitored (see labs).  
- No witnessed seizures this admission.

**6. Obesity, Deconditioning**  
- High risk for falls, pressure ulcers.  
- PT/OT daily, pressure ulcer precautions.

**7. Colon Polyp (remote), Otitis Media (remote), Ankle Sprain (remote)**  
- No acute issues.

**8. Polypharmacy**  
- Medication reconciliation ongoing, minimize sedatives and nephrotoxins.

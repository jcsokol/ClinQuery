### Hospital Course Summary

**History of Present Illness:**  
Melina Zieme, a 55-year-old female with a history notable for cardiac arrest, obesity, and recent upper respiratory tract infection, was found unresponsive at home by her daughter. EMS reported pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest; ROSC achieved after 12 minutes of ACLS. Brought to ED intubated, hypotensive, requiring norepinephrine. Initial EKG showed diffuse ST depressions. TTE revealed severely reduced LVEF (~20%), global hypokinesis. She was transferred to MICU for management of cardiogenic shock. Due to refractory hypotension and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion despite escalating vasopressors/inotropes, decision made for percutaneous placement of a left-sided Impella CP device on hospital day 1.

## ICU Daily Progress Notes

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

---

#### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock s/p Cardiac Arrest; Impella CP in place**
- **Assessment:**  
Patient in profound shock post-PEA arrest, likely secondary to acute viral myocarditis vs. ischemic insult. TTE with LVEF 20%, troponin mildly elevated (peak 0.87), no acute coronary occlusion on cath. Continued lactic acidosis, MAP < 60 mmHg despite norepi, dobutamine. Impella CP placed via R femoral artery for mechanical circulatory support.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Maintain Impella at P6, monitor flows (currently 3.1 L/min)  
  - Continue heparinized saline purge, monitor ACT q4h  
  - Titrate vasopressors/inotropes as tolerated  
  - Daily TTE to assess recovery/removal candidacy  
  - Serial lactate, mixed venous O2 sats  
  - Consider weaning Impella if LVEF >35% and off pressors  
  - Cardiology to follow  
  - Monitor for device-related complications (bleeding, hemolysis, limb ischemia)  

---

#### 2. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
- **Assessment:**  
Required intubation in field; CXR with mild pulmonary edema, no consolidation. Sedated on propofol/fentanyl.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Lung-protective ventilation (TV 6ml/kg IBW, PEEP 8)  
  - Daily sedation vacations  
  - Spontaneous breathing trial when stable  
  - Monitor for VAP  
  - Daily CXR  

---

#### 3. **Obesity (BMI 31.3 on admit)**
- **Assessment:**  
Obese, likely contributing to metabolic derangements and complicating ventilation.  
- **Plan:**  
  - DVT prophylaxis (SCDs, heparin 5000u BID)  
  - Strict I/O  
  - Nutrition consult  
  - Encourage mobility when extubated  

---

#### 4. **Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO Stage II)**
- **Assessment:**  
Creatinine rose from 1.1 baseline to 2.2 on day 2; likely multifactorial (shock, pressors, nephrotoxic meds). UOP 0.4 ml/kg/hr.  
- **Plan:**  
  - IVF as tolerated (balanced crystalloids)  
  - Avoid nephrotoxins  
  - Monitor K+, trend Cr/BUN  
  - Nephrology consult  

---

#### 5. **Transaminitis**
- **Assessment:**  
AST/ALT peaked at 123/98, likely ischemic hepatitis. No evidence of biliary obstruction.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Supportive care  
  - Monitor LFTs daily  
  - Hepatitis panel pending  

---

#### 6. **Recurrent Sinusitis/Pharyngitis**
- **Assessment:**  
History of frequent viral URIs, currently on amox-clav for presumed bacterial superinfection. No fevers after day 2.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Complete 7-day course of abx  
  - ENT consult if persistent  
  - Symptomatic management  

---

#### 7. **History of First Trimester Miscarriage**
- **Assessment:**  
Remote, no current OB/GYN issues.  
- **Plan:**  
  - No interventions needed  

---

#### 8. **Hand Laceration**
- **Assessment:**  
2cm laceration dorsal right hand, sutured on admit, no signs of infection.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Daily wound checks  
  - Remove sutures day 7  
  - Bacitracin ointment  

---

#### 9. **Hospital-acquired Anemia**
- **Assessment:**  
Hgb dropped from 13.1 to 9.5 over 4 days, likely dilutional and phlebotomy-related. No overt bleeding.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor H/H daily  
  - Iron studies, retic count  
  - Transfuse if Hgb <7 or symptomatic  

---

#### 10. **Contraceptive Management**
- **Assessment:**  
History of multiple contraceptive methods (implants, IUDs, OCPs). No acute gynecologic issues.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Hold hormonal agents during ICU stay  
  - OBGYN to reassess prior to discharge  

---

#### 11. **Pain - Mild**
- **Assessment:**  
Reports mild pain (3/10) at hand wound and with movement.  
- **Plan:**  
  - PRN acetaminophen  
  - Minimize opioids  
  - Reassess daily

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Graig Cassin is a 79-year-old male with a history of obesity, chronic sinusitis, prediabetes, anemia, osteoarthritis of the knee, and prior cardiac arrest, who was admitted to the ICU following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. He was found unresponsive at home by his wife, EMS arrived within 8 minutes, and ROSC was achieved after 2 rounds of CPR and 1 defibrillation shock. On arrival to the ED, he was hypotensive and required vasopressor support, subsequently developing cardiogenic shock. He was intubated for airway protection.

Given persistent hemodynamic instability and evidence of low cardiac output, a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 1. He remains in the ICU on day 6 of his hospital course.

## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

- **Day 0:** Cardiac arrest at home; ROSC in field; intubated in ED; initial labs reveal metabolic acidosis, AKI.
- **Day 1:** Echocardiogram shows severely reduced LVEF (20%), global hypokinesis. Persistent hypotension despite norepinephrine; Impella CP placed. Started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia.
- **Day 2:** Gradual improvement in hemodynamics. Lactate downtrending. Weaning pressors.
- **Day 3-4:** Extubated to nasal cannula. Transitioned off vasopressors. Renal function improving. Impella weaning protocol started.
- **Day 5:** Impella removed. Mobilization with PT initiated. Mild delirium noted, resolving with sleep-wake cycle normalization.
- **Day 6:** Transferred out of ICU to step-down. Discharge planning started.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Cardiac Arrest/Severe Cardiomyopathy**
- s/p out-of-hospital VF arrest, presumed ischemic etiology, no prior CAD
- Severe LV dysfunction (EF 20%)
- Managed with temporary LVAD (Impella CP), now removed
- On guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): metoprolol low dose, lisinopril held for AKI, spironolactone held
- Plan: Continue cardiac rehab, start SGLT2 inhibitor, optimize GDMT as tolerated, outpatient follow-up with HF clinic

### 2. **Cardiogenic Shock**
- Required norepinephrine and Impella for 4 days
- Now hemodynamically stable, off all pressors
- Plan: Monitor for recurrence, daily weights, strict I/Os

### 3. **Acute Kidney Injury**
- Multifactorial: hypoperfusion, contrast nephropathy
- Creatinine peaked at 2.1, now 1.1
- Plan: Continue renal dose adjustments, recheck renal panel qAM

### 4. **Obesity (BMI 30+)**
- BMI on admission: 27.8 (recent weight loss likely due to illness)
- Plan: Nutrition consult, monitor dietary intake

### 5. **Prediabetes**
- A1c 6.4%
- Plan: Monitor glucose, consider metformin if renal function stable

### 6. **Chronic Sinusitis**
- Stable, no acute exacerbation
- Plan: Resume fluticasone nasal spray on step-down

### 7. **Anemia**
- Hgb nadir 9.4, now 10.8 (baseline ~11), likely anemia of chronic disease
- Plan: Monitor, no transfusion needed

### 8. **Osteoarthritis (knee)**
- Baseline naproxen PRN, held inpatient due to renal dysfunction
- Plan: Resume acetaminophen for pain, PT consult

### 9. **Delirium**
- Mild agitation, improved with sleep hygiene
- Plan: Continue non-pharmacologic management

### 10. **Aspiration Pneumonia (presumed)**
- Treated with ceftriaxone + azithromycin x 5d; afebrile, WBC normalized
- Plan: Monitor, CXR on step-down

## PHYSICAL EXAM (Day 6, AM round)

- **General:** Awake, alert, NAD
- **HEENT:** Oropharynx clear, mild nasal congestion
- **Heart:** Regular, S1/S2, no murmurs, no gallop
- **Lungs:** CTAB, bibasilar crackles improved
- **Abdomen:** Soft, NT/ND
- **Extremities:** No edema, good pulses
- **Neuro:** AOx3, moving all extremities

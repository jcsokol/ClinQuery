### CHIEF COMPLAINT

Progressive SOB, orthopnea, fatigue, confusion.  
Brought in by EMS after a syncopal episode at home.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jaime Molina is a 64-year-old male with a history of prediabetes, chronic sinusitis (frequent viral exacerbations), and chronic mild anemia who presented with acute-on-chronic SOB, orthopnea, and near-syncope. He was found at home confused and hypotensive by his wife, who called EMS. EMS noted tachycardia and O2 sat 86% on RA, improved to 94% on 4L NC. On arrival to ED, hypotensive (SBP 78 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 121), and in moderate respiratory distress. CXR: Pulm edema, cardiomegaly. ECG: Sinus tachycardia, no STEMI. Troponin mildly elevated. Echo: LVEF 15%, severe global hypokinesis, RV mildly reduced. No prior cardiac hx.

He was admitted to ICU for cardiogenic shock (cold/wet), required norepinephrine, dobutamine, and subsequently underwent emergent placement of a temporary percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) due to persistent shock.

Course complicated by ongoing volume overload, AKI, and ongoing anemia. Also, chronic sinusitis flared during stay, requiring ENT eval and abx.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic shock (resolved), acute decompensated HF (EF 15â€“23%)
- Initial: Norepi, dobutamine, diuresis, then Impella
- Now: Off pressors, Impella explanted, hemodynamically stable
- Plan: Continue gentle diuresis, uptitrate GDMT as tolerated (ACEi, BB), monitor for recurrent shock, daily weights, strict I/Os

### 2. Acute kidney injury (multifactorial: prerenal, cardiorenal)
- Cr peaked 1.9, improved to 1.3
- Plan: Renal dose diuretics, avoid nephrotoxins, monitor lytes, daily BMP

### 3. Anemia (chronic, worsened acutely)
- Baseline Hgb 13, nadir to 9.8 during stay
- Iron-deficiency on workup, no active bleed
- Plan: Continue oral iron, monitor Hgb, consider GI eval outpatient

### 4. Chronic sinusitis, acute viral flare with secondary bacterial infection
- ENT: purulent discharge, facial tenderness
- Plan: Augmentin x10d, nasal saline, follow-up ENT outpatient

### 5. Prediabetes
- A1c 6.2% on admission
- Plan: Monitor glucose, diabetic diet, f/u PCP

### 6. Hyperlipidemia (untreated)
- TC 173, LDL 78, HDL 74, TG 104
- Plan: Start statin when stable, f/u lipid panel outpatient

### 7. Hospital-acquired infection risk
- On broad-spectrum abx, now narrowed
- Plan: Monitor for fever, WBC, remove lines ASAP

### 8. Disposition/Social
- Stable for step-down, discharge planning with wife
- Needs HF teaching, home BP cuff, scale

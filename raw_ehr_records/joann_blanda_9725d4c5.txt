### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Ms. Joann Blanda is a 69-year-old female with significant cardiovascular risk factors who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, chest tightness, and near-syncope. She was found to be hypotensive (BP 78/54), tachycardic (HR 114), and hypoxic (O2 sat 87% RA). Initial labs revealed elevated troponin (see below), acute on chronic anemia, and evidence of multiorgan hypoperfusion (increased lactate, mild transaminitis, AKI). CXR: pulmonary edema, mild cardiomegaly. ECG: NSR, Q waves in II, III, aVF.

She rapidly deteriorated with progressive hypotension unresponsive to fluids and was transferred to the cardiac ICU for inotropic support. Despite escalating pressors and dobutamine, she remained in refractory cardiogenic shock. Emergent placement of a left-sided percutaneous ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was performed for hemodynamic stabilization.

Over the ensuing days, her course was complicated by acute kidney injury, persistent anemia, and intermittent fever (r/o infection). She was successfully weaned off the Impella on hospital day 5, transitioned to milrinone, and ultimately stabilized on goal-directed medical therapy for HF. She remains hospitalized for ongoing rehabilitation and optimization of comorbidities.

### PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

#### 1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
- **Assessment:** Acute LV failure likely ischemic (possibly silent MI) on background of metabolic syndrome. Required Impella CP for stabilization.
- **Plan:**
  - Continue GDMT: carvedilol, sacubitril-valsartan, spironolactone (as tolerated)
  - Daily echo to monitor LV function
  - Titrate diuretics for euvolemia, strict I/O
  - Wean inotropes as tolerated—now on low-dose milrinone
  - Monitor for arrhythmia, end-organ dysfunction
  - Cardiac rehab consult, daily PT/OT
  - Plan for outpatient ICD eval

#### 2. Anemia (Chronic, with Acute on Chronic Component)
- **Assessment:** Baseline anemia (likely multifactorial: CKD, nutritional, chronic inflammation), with drop in Hgb during hospitalization (nadir 7.8 g/dL).
- **Plan:**
  - Trend CBC q12-24h
  - Iron studies, B12, folate (see labs)
  - Transfused 1U PRBCs on HD#3
  - Continue B12 supplementation
  - GI consult for possible occult blood loss

#### 3. Acute Kidney Injury (on CKD)
- **Assessment:** Multifactorial—pre-renal (hypoperfusion), nephrotoxic meds, possible contrast exposure.
- **Plan:**
  - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
  - Daily BMP, monitor Cr/K
  - IVF challenge (initial), now on gentle diuresis
  - Renal ultrasound: no obstruction
  - Renal consult—no dialysis required

#### 4. Hyperlipidemia / ASCVD Risk
- **Assessment:** LDL persistently elevated; nonadherence reported.
- **Plan:**
  - Reinforce statin compliance (simvastatin 10 mg qHS)
  - Consider switch to high-intensity statin at discharge
  - Dietician consult

#### 5. Prediabetes / Metabolic Syndrome
- **Assessment:** HbA1c 6.1%; fasting glucose variable (see labs).
- **Plan:**
  - Endocrine consult
  - Diabetic diet, monitor glucose BID
  - Outpatient follow-up for DM prevention program

#### 6. Obesity (BMI ~29-30)
- **Assessment:** Contributes to HF, OSA, metabolic syndrome.
- **Plan:**
  - Nutritionist consult—calorie restriction, low salt
  - Encourage mobility as tolerated

#### 7. Acute Bronchitis / Viral Pharyngitis (Resolved)
- **Assessment:** Symptoms resolved on admission, no evidence of superimposed pneumonia.
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor for secondary infection
  - Supportive care only

#### 8. Infection Surveillance
- **Assessment:** Intermittent fevers; blood/urine cultures negative. Line site clean.
- **Plan:**
  - Continue to monitor WBC, cultures PRN
  - Remove invasive lines ASAP

#### 9. Other Issues
- DVT prophylaxis: SCDs, LMWH
- Pain: mild, managed with acetaminophen PRN
- Sleep disturbance: non-pharmacologic measures
- Social work/Case management for disposition

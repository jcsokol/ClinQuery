## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, and palpitations for 1 week prior to admission.

**HPI:**  
Deon Ankunding, a 113-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic sinusitis, atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), prior ischemic stroke (non-disabling), and remote colon polyps, presented with acute shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest heaviness. On arrival, he was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation (HR 152), hypotensive (BP 74/41), and hypoxic (SpO2 87% RA). Initial exam revealed evidence of pulmonary edema and cool extremities. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock.

Due to persistent shock refractory to vasoactive agents and inotropes, he underwent urgent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2 for hemodynamic support. He required intubation for respiratory failure on day 2, was extubated successfully on day 6, and the Impella device was removed on day 7 after stabilization. His course was complicated by acute kidney injury, supratherapeutic INR, and nosocomial pneumonia.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**Active Problems:**
1. **Cardiogenic Shock s/p Impella LVAD (Temporary) placement**
   - Day 2: Required Impella CP for refractory shock.
   - Weaned off vasoactives on day 5, Impella explanted day 7.
   - **Plan:** Continue hemodynamic monitoring, daily TTE, optimize volume status, serial lactate.

2. **Decompensated Heart Failure (EF 18%)**
   - Hx longstanding HTN, now with severe LV dysfunction.
   - **Plan:** Resume GDMT as tolerated, monitor BNP, fluid balance, diuresis with IV furosemide.

3. **Atrial Fibrillation (on warfarin)**
   - RVR on admission, now rate controlled.
   - Supratherapeutic INR (max 4.7), held warfarin x2 days, now bridged with heparin.
   - **Plan:** Monitor INR, restart warfarin at reduced dose, maintain HR < 90.

4. **Acute Kidney Injury (Stage II)**
   - Creatinine peaked at 2.3 (baseline 1.0), likely multifactorial (hypoperfusion, diuretics).
   - **Plan:** Renal dosing for all meds, monitor daily BMP, nephrology consult.

5. **Hospital-acquired pneumonia**
   - Fever (38.2C), new infiltrate on CXR, sputum cultures pending.
   - **Plan:** Continue cefepime + azithro, monitor WBC, procalcitonin.

6. **History of Stroke**
   - No new deficits, on DVT ppx during warfarin hold.
   - **Plan:** Neuro checks q4h, PT/OT.

7. **Colon polyps (remote)**
   - No active GI symptoms.
   - **Plan:** Resume colonoscopy screening when stable.

8. **Chronic sinusitis**
   - No acute symptoms.
   - **Plan:** Continue home meds.

**Prophylaxis:** PPI for GI, heparin for DVT (during INR <2), SCDs  
**Lines/Tubes:** Right IJ TLC, left radial A-line, Foley (removed day 6), Impella (removed day 7)  
**Nutrition:** NPO until extubation, now on cardiac diet  
**Disposition:** Remains ICU, plan transfer to telemetry when stable

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN (Expanded)

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock s/p Temporary Impella LVAD Placement
- **Summary:** Refractory shock from severe LV dysfunction; Impella placed for 5 days, now removed.
- **Plan:** Monitor for device-related complications (hemolysis, limb ischemia), serial echocardiograms, optimize afterload and preload, continue inotropes as needed, transition to oral therapy.

### 2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
- **Summary:** Severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF 18%), likely ischemic and hypertensive.
- **Plan:** Gentle diuresis, goal euvolemia, uptitrate GDMT, strict I/O, daily weights, monitor electrolytes, low-salt diet.

### 3. Atrial Fibrillation
- **Summary:** Paroxysmal, rate-controlled, anticoagulation complicated by supratherapeutic INR.
- **Plan:** Monitor rhythm, continue warfarin with INR goal 2–3, consider amiodarone if recurrent RVR.

### 4. AKI on CKD

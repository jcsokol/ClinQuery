## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Jeffrey MacGyver is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obesity (BMI ~30), osteoarthritis (knee), and recent acute bronchitis, presenting with 4 days of worsening dyspnea, productive cough, and fatigue. He was initially seen in the ED for hypoxia (O2 sat 87% RA), tachycardia, and hypotension. On arrival, he was found to have bibasilar crackles, JVD, and 2+ pitting edema. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Transthoracic echo revealed severe global LV dysfunction (EF 15%), moderate MR, and RV dysfunction. Troponins mildly elevated. He developed worsening cardiogenic shock (SBP < 85 mmHg, lactate 4.2), refractory to high-dose vasopressors and inotropes. Emergent Impella CP (percutaneous LVAD) placed in cath lab on HD1 for hemodynamic support.

## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**Day 0-1:**  
Admitted for acute decompensated heart failure, rapidly progressing to cardiogenic shock. Placed on norepinephrine, dobutamine. Emergent Impella CP placed via femoral approach. Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Diuresis started.

**Day 2-3:**  
Persistent low urine output, rising creatinine (peak 2.2 mg/dL). CVVH initiated. Infectious workup negative. Echo: No tamponade, Impella flows 3.2 L/min. Weaned off norepinephrine, still requiring dobutamine.

**Day 4-5:**  
Improvement in end-organ perfusion, lactate normalized. Impella weaned, explanted on HD5. Extubated to HFNC. Renal function improving. Mobilized to chair with PT.

**Day 6-7:**  
Stable hemodynamics. Transitioned to oral HF regimen (carvedilol, sacubitril-valsartan, spironolactone). Transferred to cardiac stepdown.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (new severe LV systolic dysfunction)
- Emergent Impella CP for mechanical support, now explanted
- Vasopressors/inotropes as above, now discontinued
- Monitoring for arrhythmias, volume status
- Transitioned to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): beta-blocker, ARNI, MRA
- Daily weights, strict I/Os
- Cardiology f/u; consider advanced therapies if no recovery

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (cardiorenal syndrome, oliguric, requiring CRRT)
- CRRT 4/15–4/18, now off
- Renal function improving, monitor labs
- Avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal dosing

### 3. Respiratory Failure, Hypoxic (secondary to pulmonary edema)
- Intubated, now extubated to high flow, now NC
- Diuresis, fluid management

### 4. Hypertension (chronic)
- Restart home antihypertensives as tolerated
- Monitor BP closely

### 5. Obesity
- Dietician consult, calorie restriction, PT for mobility

### 6. Osteoarthritis, bilateral knees
- Naproxen held during AKI, now resumed prn
- PT/OT for mobility

### 7. Recent Acute Bronchitis

### 8. DVT Prophylaxis
- SCDs, SQ heparin

### 9. Nutrition
- NPO initially, now on cardiac diet

### 10. Disposition Planning
- Anticipate stepdown transfer, then home with cardiac follow-up

*** EPIC EHR - ICU ADMISSION NOTE ***

PATIENT NAME: Nancy Wisozk  
MRN: 0453981  
DOB: 08/14/2004 (Age: 19)  
SEX: Female  
Date of Admission: 2024-05-30  
Date of Note: 2024-06-03  
Attending: Dr. H. Figueroa  
Consultants: Cardiology, Infectious Disease  
Location: MICU, Room 18B  

*** CHIEF COMPLAINT ***  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and fatigue.

*** HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ***  
Nancy Wisozk is a previously healthy 19-year-old female with a recent history of upper respiratory infection (initially viral, then complicated by acute bacterial sinusitis), presenting with 5 days of worsening dyspnea, palpitations, and fatigue. She was treated outpatient with naproxen and supportive care for sinusitis two weeks ago. Over the past week, she developed severe fatigue, lower extremity edema, and reduced urine output. On the day of admission, she became acutely tachypneic and hypotensive, prompting EMS activation.  

On arrival, she was found to be hypotensive (BP 82/48 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 122 bpm), tachypneic (RR 28), and hypoxic (SpO2 91% on 4L NC). She was transferred to the ICU for acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock, requiring inotropic support. Echocardiogram revealed severely reduced LVEF (15%) with global hypokinesis. Given progressive shock, a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed emergently at bedside.

*Note: Some values missing as not all tests resulted each day.*

*** MICROBIOLOGY ***
- Blood cultures x2: No growth (Day 1, Day 2)
- Nasal PCR panel: Negative for viral pathogens

*** IMAGING ***
- CXR: Bilateral pulmonary edema, mild cardiomegaly
- Echo (Day 1): LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, mild MR, no pericardial effusion
- Echo (Day 4): LVEF 28%, improved wall motion

*** ASSESSMENT & PLAN ***

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, likely viral myocarditis**  
- Presentation, echo, and rapid decline suggestful of fulminant myocarditis (possibly post-viral).  
- Required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.  
- Plan:  
  - Continue Impella support, gradual wean as tolerated  
  - Daily echo to assess function  
  - Wean inotropes as tolerated  
  - Monitor for arrhythmias, anticoagulate per protocol  
  - Cardiology to follow

**2. Acute Kidney Injury, likely pre-renal**  
- Oliguria, Cr peaked at 2.0, improved with better MAPs  
- Plan:  
  - Strict I/Os, daily BMP  
  - Avoid nephrotoxins  
  - Renal consult if worsening

**3. Acute Transaminitis**  
- AST/ALT peaked on Day 3, improved since  
- Likely ischemic hepatitis secondary to low flow  
- Plan:  
  - Monitor LFTs  
  - Supportive care

**4. Decompensated Heart Failure**  
- Managed with inotropes, diuresis (once stable).  
- Plan:  
  - IV furosemide as tolerated  
  - Sodium restriction

**5. Recent Sinusitis (viral and bacterial)**  
- No current signs of active infection  
- Plan:  
  - No antibiotics unless new infection suspected

**6. VTE Prophylaxis**  
- On enoxaparin

**7. Nutrition**  
- NPO initially, now advancing to cardiac diet as tolerated

**8. Physical Therapy**  
- Consulted for early mobilization as feasible

**9. Psychosocial**  
- Family updated daily, social work involved

*** DISPOSITION ***
- Remains in ICU, improving. Anticipate step-down to telemetry in 1-2 days if stable off Impella/inotropes.

## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Acute shortness of breath, altered mental status

---

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
41-year-old female with a history significant for seizure disorder (on carbamazepine, clonazepam, diazepam), prior single seizure, recent closed hip fracture (s/p ORIF 2 weeks ago), and viral sinusitis presents with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and confusion. Family reports a witnessed syncopal episode at home. She was brought to the ED, found to be hypotensive (SBP 74), tachycardic, and hypoxic. On arrival, she was in acute respiratory distress with evidence of pulmonary edema on exam and CXR. Given persistent hypotension and shock despite fluids and vasopressors, she was admitted to the ICU and ultimately required placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock, presumed secondary to acute decompensated heart failure.

## HOSPITAL COURSE
- **Day 1-2:** Admitted to ICU. Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Started on norepinephrine. Labs notable for elevated troponin, BNP, transaminitis, and lactate. Echo showed LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, mild RV dysfunction. Impella CP device placed via femoral approach.
- **Day 3-5:** Gradual improvement in end-organ perfusion. Extubated on Day 4. Vasopressors weaned. Developed new fever, elevated WBC—concern for device-related infection, empiric vancomycin/cefepime started. Blood cultures negative.
- **Day 6-8:** Impella weaned and explanted. Mental status improved. Physical therapy started for deconditioning and prior hip fracture. Carbamazepine levels monitored. No recurrent seizures. Mildly elevated LFTs improved off vasopressors.
- **Day 9:** Transferred to stepdown. Ongoing workup for underlying cardiomyopathy (suspected viral or arrhythmia-related). Discharge planning for acute rehab.

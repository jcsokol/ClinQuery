### HOSPITAL COURSE (Summary)
Mr. Rory Bauch is a 113-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic opioid use, tobacco use, prediabetes, chronic anemia, gout, metastatic prostate cancer (s/p docetaxel and leuprolide), Alzheimer’s dementia, osteoporosis, and pneumonia. He was admitted from the SNF with acute-on-chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. He rapidly decompensated in the ED, requiring intubation and vasopressor support. An echocardiogram revealed severe global LV hypokinesis with EF ~15%. He was transferred to the ICU, where he developed cardiogenic shock refractory to medical management. A percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed for temporary hemodynamic support.

His course was complicated by AKI (now improving), anemia requiring transfusion, delirium, and recurrent infections. He is now extubated, on minimal pressors, and the Impella is being weaned.

### IMAGING
- **CXR 6/17**: Bilateral patchy opacities, most pronounced at lower lobes, consistent with pneumonia. Mild cardiomegaly.
- **Echo 6/17**: Severe global LV hypokinesis, EF 15%. Mild RV dysfunction. No significant valvular disease.
- **CT Head 6/17**: Chronic microvascular changes. No acute infarct or hemorrhage.

---

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Severe Systolic HF (EF 15%)**
   - Likely multifactorial: ischemic, chemotherapy-induced, chronic hypertension.
   - Required percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support on 6/17.
   - On milrinone and low-dose norepinephrine, now weaning both.
   - Daily echo to assess LV recovery.
   - Plan: Continue LVAD wean. Evaluate for transition to palliative care vs. advanced therapies; unlikely candidate for durable LVAD or transplant due to age, comorbidities.

2. **Acute-on-Chronic Anemia**
   - Hgb nadir 9.4; received 2U PRBC on 6/18.
   - Etiology: chronic disease, marrow suppression (chemo), possible GI losses (no melena, stool hemoccult negative).
   - Monitoring CBC daily.
   - Plan: Transfuse for Hgb <8.5, iron studies pending.

3. **Pneumonia**
   - Community-acquired, likely aspiration (dementia, debility).
   - Blood/sputum cultures negative.
   - Completed 5 days ceftriaxone & azithromycin.
   - Plan: Pulmonary hygiene, monitor for recurrence.

4. **Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO 2, now improving)**
   - Likely secondary to shock, nephrotoxins (contrast, diuretics).
   - Creatinine peaked at 1.39, now 0.71.
   - Plan: Avoid nephrotoxins, daily renal panel, strict I/O, diurese as needed.

5. **Delirium/Advanced Dementia**
   - Baseline severe cognitive impairment (MMSE 3/30).
   - Hospital course complicated by hypoactive delirium.
   - Plan: Re-orientation, minimize sedatives, family at bedside.

6. **Prostate Cancer (Metastatic)**
   - Receiving docetaxel, leuprolide.
   - Complicated by recurrent infections, debility.
   - Plan: Oncology following, consider holding chemo pending recovery.

7. **Opioid Use Disorder**
   - On chronic opioids for cancer pain.
   - Pain controlled (2-4/10).
   - Plan: Continue current regimen, monitor for withdrawal/over-sedation.

8. **Hypertension/Prediabetes/Gout/Osteoporosis**
   - BP controlled on current regimen.
   - Colchicine and allopurinol resumed as able.
   - DXA T-score -2.9, at risk for fractures.
   - Plan: Continue secondary prevention, encourage mobility.

9. **Tobacco Use**
   - On nicotine patch.
   - Plan: Continue patch, offer counseling.

## History of Present Illness

Carley Paucek is a 63-year-old female with a history notable for obesity (BMI ~29), prediabetes, chronic anemia, history of 1st trimester miscarriage, prior normal pregnancy, remote viral sinusitis, and right rotator cuff tendon injury. She presented to the ED after 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest heaviness. She denied fever, cough, or sick contacts. She reported mild bilateral lower extremity swelling. Home medications: Mirena IUD. She was found to be hypotensive (SBP 82 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 116), and hypoxic (SpO2 91% on RA). Initial ECG showed sinus tachycardia, low voltage. Troponin mildly elevated; BNP elevated. CXR: pulmonary vascular congestion. Echo: LVEF 18%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR, RV mildly reduced.

She developed worsening cardiogenic shock (cold extremities, oliguria, lactate 4.6), requiring vasopressor support and urgent placement of a left-sided Impella CP device for temporary mechanical circulatory support. She was transferred to the ICU for further management.

## Hospital Course Summary

**ICU Day 1–2:**  
- Hemodynamic instability (MAP <60) despite norepinephrine, dobutamine.  
- Impella CP placed via R femoral artery without immediate complication.  
- UOP improved, lactate trending down.  
- Persistent pulmonary edema requiring BiPAP.  
- Cardiac cath: non-obstructive CAD, severe global LV dysfunction (likely non-ischemic).  
- Infectious workup negative.

**ICU Day 3–5:**  
- Gradual weaning of vasopressors. Impella flows maintained.  
- Diuresis with IV furosemide.  
- Monitored for hemolysis (LDH, haptoglobin), minor drop in Hgb noted.  
- Endo consult for prediabetes: insulin sliding scale started due to stress hyperglycemia.  
- Nutrition consult: enteral feeds initiated.

**ICU Day 6–7:**  
- Impella weaned and explanted on ICU day 7.  
- Transitioned to low-dose dobutamine, then off all pressors.  
- Marked clinical improvement.  
- Transferred to telemetry floor for ongoing monitoring.

## Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Systolic Heart Failure (EF 18%)  
- Etiology: likely non-ischemic (myocarditis vs. idiopathic).  
- Management:  
  - Temporary LV support (Impella CP, now explanted).  
  - IV vasopressors/inotropes as needed.  
  - Diuresis with IV furosemide.  
  - Strict I/O, daily weights.  
  - Serial TTEs to monitor LV recovery.  
  - Plan: optimize GDMT, close f/u with Heart Failure clinic.

### 2. Anemia  
- Baseline Hgb ~12, dropped to 9.2 post-Impella (likely hemolysis).  
- Monitored LDH, haptoglobin, retic.  
- No overt bleeding.  
- Plan: Monitor, iron studies, consider EPO if persistent.

### 3. Obesity / Prediabetes  
- BMI ~29, A1c 6.3%.  
- Stress hyperglycemia during admission, managed with insulin sliding scale.  
- Plan: Endo F/U, nutrition counseling, consider Metformin if persistent hyperglycemia.

### 4. Oliguria/AKI (resolved)  
- Creatinine peaked at 1.7, now improved to baseline (0.9).  
- Plan: Renal function monitoring, avoid nephrotoxins.

### 5. Mechanical Circulatory Support (Impella)  
- Placed day 1, explanted day 7.  
- Monitored for device complications (bleeding, hemolysis, limb ischemia).  
- No major complications.

### 6. Rotator Cuff Injury  
- Chronic, no acute management required this admission.

### 7. Other  
- Mirena IUD in place, no GYN issues.  
- DVT prophylaxis: SCDs, SQ heparin.  
- Vaccinations up to date.

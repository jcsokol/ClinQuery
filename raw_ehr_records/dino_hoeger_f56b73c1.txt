**DOB:** 1960-02-15 (Age: 64)  
**Sex:** Male  
**Date of Admission:** 2024-05-21  
**Date of Note:** 2024-05-28  
**Attending:** Dr. S. Hwang  
**Consultants:** Cardiology, Neurology, Pain Management, Infectious Disease  
**Location:** MICU, Room 14B

**HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:**

Mr. Dino Hoeger is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic intractable migraine, chronic pain, multiple recent viral URIs, and prior drug overdose, who presented to the ED with acute-onset chest pain, dyspnea, and confusion. Patient was found to be hypotensive (SBP 74 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 128), and hypoxic (SpO₂ 88% RA). EKG showed diffuse ST depressions. Troponin I peaked at 12.7 ng/mL. Bedside TTE revealed severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, and a dilated LV. Despite initial resuscitation, patient developed cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressor and inotrope support. Due to persistent instability, an emergent left-sided percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) was placed at bedside. 

Course was complicated by AKI, transient transaminitis, delirium, and difficult-to-control pain. Patient was stabilized over several days, weaned off vasopressors, and LVAD was explanted on day 5. He is now on telemetry, improving.

**PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to acute decompensated heart failure**
- Hx: No prior heart failure. Presented with acute pulmonary edema, hypotension, elevated troponin, severely reduced EF.
- Etiology: Likely ischemic vs. toxic/metabolic insult (history of drug overdose, chronic pain medications).
- Hospital Course: Required Impella CP for 5 days, vasopressors (norepinephrine, dobutamine), diuresis.
- Echo: LVEF up to 25% on day 7, mild MR, no LV thrombus.
- Plan:
  - Continue GDMT (beta blocker, ACEi as tolerated, spironolactone).
  - Monitor for arrhythmia, volume status.
  - Cardiac rehab consult.
  - CTA chest/abdomen pending to r/o atheroembolism.
  - Cardiology f/u post-discharge.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO Stage 2, multifactorial)**
- Baseline Cr 1.0, peak 2.3, now trending down.
- Likely pre-renal (shock, diuretics) + nephrotoxic exposure (contrast).
- Plan:
  - Strict I/Os, daily weights.
  - Hold nephrotoxins.
  - Renal function q12h.
  - Nephrology consult if not improving.

**3. Chronic Pain / Opioid Use Disorder**
- Longstanding pain syndrome, on chronic oxycodone and hydrocodone.
- Hospital course complicated by withdrawal/agitation on admission.
- Plan:
  - Pain management consult.
  - Transition to oral regimen as tolerated.
  - Consider buprenorphine bridge.
  - Monitor for sedation/respiratory depression.

**4. Hypertension**
- Home on atenolol/chlorthalidone.
- BP labile throughout admission (hypotensive during shock, now hypertensive).
- Plan:
  - Restart home regimen as tolerated.
  - Monitor for rebound hypertension/orthostasis.

**5. Delirium/Encephalopathy**
- Initially agitated, visual hallucinations, fluctuating consciousness.
- Likely multifactorial: shock, infection, metabolic, withdrawal.
- Improved with reorientation, sleep hygiene, and pain control.
- Plan:
  - Minimize sedatives.
  - PT/OT consult for cognitive rehab.

**6. Acute Viral Pharyngitis & Bronchitis (Resolved)**
- Presented with cough, sore throat, URI sxs, positive viral PCR (rhinovirus).
- No evidence of pneumonia.
- Plan:
  - Supportive care.
  - Monitor for secondary bacterial infection.

**7. Hyperlipidemia**
- LDL 79, triglycerides 124, HDL 80.
- Plan:
  - Statin therapy (atorvastatin 40mg qHS).
  - Outpatient lipid clinic referral.

**8. Dental Issues / Impacted Molars**
- Chronic issue, not addressed this admission.
- Plan:
  - Dental follow-up post-discharge.

**9. Migraine (chronic, intractable)**
- Home abortive and preventive therapies.
- No acute episodes this admission.
- Plan:
  - Continue home meds.
  - Neurology follow-up.

**10. Social/Disposition**
- Lives alone, limited support.
- PT/OT: moderate deconditioning.
- Plan:
  - Discharge planning with case management.
  - Consider SNF vs. home with VNA.

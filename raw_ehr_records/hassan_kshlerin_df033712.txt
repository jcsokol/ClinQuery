## History of Present Illness

Mr. Hassan Kshlerin is a 56-year-old male with a PMHx notable for obesity, prediabetes, anemia, and OA of both knees, who presented to the ED with progressive exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema over 1 week. He reported a 3-day history of worsening fatigue, lightheadedness, and mild chest discomfort. No fevers, cough, or GI symptoms. He has a remote history of appendectomy. Home meds include ferrous sulfate and naproxen.

In the ED, he was tachypneic, hypotensive (BP 88/52), tachycardic (HR 116), and hypoxic (O2 sat 88% RA). CXR: pulmonary vascular congestion, mild bilateral pleural effusions. BNP 1440. Troponin I peaked at 0.21. Echo: severely reduced LVEF (15%), global hypokinesis, LV dilation. He developed worsening hypotension despite IV diuretics and dobutamine infusion, requiring transfer to the MICU. Due to persistent cardiogenic shock, a temporary percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) was placed on HD2.

## Hospital Course (04/14/24 - 04/22/24)

- **HD1:** Admitted to MICU for ADHF/shock. Started on dobutamine, IV furosemide. Vasopressors initiated for MAP <60. Labs showed worsening metabolic acidosis, AKI.
- **HD2:** Cardiogenic shock refractory to pressors/inotropes. Emergent Impella CP placed. Improved hemodynamics post-placement. Extubated to BiPAP.
- **HD3-4:** Mild hemolysis noted (LDH up, haptoglobin down), but no device malfunction. Volume status optimized. Anemia managed with transfusion x1.
- **HD5:** Renal function improved. Weaned off vasopressors. Mobilized to chair. 
- **HD6:** Impella weaned off and removed. Transitioned to oral HF regimen (metoprolol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone).
- **HD7:** Transferred to stepdown. Stable hemodynamics. Discharge planning initiated.

## Problem List & Assessment/Plan

### 1. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) / Cardiogenic Shock (new)

**Assessment:**  
Severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF 15%) with shock, likely ischemic vs. idiopathic. Required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for support. Improved post-device.

**Plan:**  
- Continue guideline-directed HF therapy (carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone, furosemide PO).
- Daily weights, strict I&O, low Na diet.
- Cardiology f/u, cardiac rehab referral.
- Outpt eval for potential advanced therapies (ICD, CRT).

### 2. Anemia (chronic, likely multifactorial: CKD, chronic disease, iron deficiency)

**Assessment:**  
Baseline Hgb 11-12. Dropped to 8.2 on HD3 (hemolysis, blood loss, hemodilution). Received 1 unit PRBC. Improved to 9.7 by discharge.

**Plan:**  
- Continue iron supplementation.
- Monitor H/H.
- Outpt GI workup if persistent.

### 3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) - prerenal, now resolved

**Assessment:**  
AKI on admission (Cr 2.1, baseline 1.1), likely cardiorenal. Improved with volume optimization and restoration of perfusion.

**Plan:**  
- Monitor lytes/renal fxn.
- Avoid nephrotoxins.
- Follow-up labs in 2 weeks.

### 4. Obesity (BMI 30+)

**Assessment:**  
Risk factor for HF, OSA, OA.

**Plan:**  
- Dietician consult.
- Encourage weight loss, exercise as tolerated.

### 5. Prediabetes

**Assessment:**  
A1C 5.9%. No insulin requirement.

**Plan:**  
- Diabetic diet.
- Monitor fasting glucose.

### 6. Osteoarthritis - bilateral knees

**Assessment:**  
Chronic, pain managed with NSAIDs.

**Plan:**  
- Continue naproxen PRN (monitor renal fxn).
- Physical therapy referral.

### 7. S/P Appendectomy

**Assessment:**  
Remote, no issues.

**Plan:**  
- No acute needs.

### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Shortness of breath, chest heaviness, and syncope

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

42-year-old female with history of obesity (BMI 37), HTN, recurrent sinusitis, prior miscarriage, and recent viral URI, presented to ED with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest pressure. She also reported 1 syncopal episode at home. No recent travel, sick contacts, or known cardiac hx. She was found to be tachycardic and hypoxic in the ED, with mild hypotension and cool extremities.

Initial ECG showed sinus tachycardia, no ST elevations. Troponin mildly elevated. CXR: Pulmonary edema. Echo in ED: LVEF ~18%, severe global hypokinesis, no LV thrombus, mild MR. Despite IV diuresis and noninvasive ventilation, she developed worsening hypotension and lactic acidosis, requiring ICU transfer.

On hospital day 1, she had progressive cardiogenic shock refractory to maximum medical therapy, and a percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) was placed for hemodynamic support.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**42F with obesity, HTN, recent URI, presenting with decompensated HF and cardiogenic shock, requiring temporary LVAD (Impella) support.**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Systolic HF (likely viral myocarditis vs. idiopathic):**  
- Impella placed day 1, removed day 4 after LVEF improved  
- Continue guideline-directed therapy (ACEi, BB, MRA)  
- Monitor for recurrent arrhythmia, hemodynamics  
- Daily weights, strict I/O  
- Consider cardiac MRI as outpatient  
- Cardiology, HF team following

**2. Impella Management / Anticoagulation:**  
- Heparin drip while device in place  
- Monitor for hemolysis, device complications  
- Serial CBC, LDH, haptoglobin, plasma-free Hgb  
- Now off device, transition to SC heparin for DVT ppx

**3. Acute Kidney Injury:**  
- Likely multifactorial (low perfusion, diuretics)  
- Monitor renal function, trend daily BMP  
- Renal function improving  
- Avoid nephrotoxins

**4. Volume Overload / Respiratory Failure:**  
- Diuresed with IV furosemide  
- Now euvolemic, off ventilator  
- Monitor for pulmonary edema

**5. Fever / Infectious Concerns:**  
- Fever day 1-2, negative blood/resp cultures  
- Procalcitonin low  
- Abx discontinued, likely SIRS from cardiac failure

**6. Hypertension / Chronic Disease Management:**  
- Resume HCTZ when renal function stable  
- Continue ACEi, BB  
- Lifestyle counseling, dietician consult

**7. Obesity:**  
- Nutrition, PT/OT consults  
- Weight loss counseling

**8. Reproductive Health:**  
- Continue current contraception  
- GYN consult for follow-up

**9. DVT Prophylaxis:**  
- SCDs, SC heparin

**10. Psychosocial / Disposition:**  
- SW involved, partner at bedside  
- Plan for transfer to stepdown, then home with close HF f/u

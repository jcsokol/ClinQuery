### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Morgan Wisoky is a 44-year-old male with a PMH significant for obesity, prediabetes, anemia, and a recent right foot laceration, admitted via ED after presenting with acute-onset dyspnea, orthopnea, and near-syncope. On arrival, patient was hypotensive (BP 76/45 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 118), with cool extremities and JVD. Troponin I was elevated, BNP elevated, CXR with pulmonary edema. Echo showed severe global LV dysfunction, EF ~15%. Despite IV diuresis and inotropes, patient deteriorated into cardiogenic shock requiring ICU transfer and urgent placement of a temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

Over the course of the ICU stay, patient developed acute kidney injury, anemia worsened, and was treated for volume overload. He received supportive therapy (diuretics, pressors, transfusion, wound care), and was gradually weaned off mechanical support. He was transitioned from IV to oral meds, and transferred out of ICU on hospital day #8.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN (by problem):

### 1. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure / Cardiogenic Shock (Primary Problem)
- **Summary:** Presented with severe LV dysfunction (EF 15%), refractory to medical therapy, required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for 5 days.
- **Course:** Gradual improvement in hemodynamics, weaned off Impella POD#5.
- **Plan:**
  - Continue guideline-directed HF therapy (carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone as tolerated)
  - Daily weights, I/Os, fluid restriction 1.5L/day
  - Monitor for arrhythmia, renal function, volume status
  - Cardiology f/u, consider advanced therapies if recurrent decompensation

### 2. Anemia (Hx + Worsened During Admission)
- **Baseline:** Chronic anemia, likely multifactorial (chronic disease, iron deficiency, B12 deficiency)
- **Course:** Hgb nadir 7.9 g/dL on HD#3; transfused 1U PRBC, improved to 9.2 g/dL.
- **Labs:** Iron studies pending, B12 low-normal, retic mildly elevated.
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor CBC daily
  - Continue B12 injections, iron supplementation if iron deficiency confirmed
  - GI workup outpatient

### 3. Acute Kidney Injury (on CKD?)
- **Course:** Creatinine peaked at 2.1 (baseline 1.1), likely multifactorial (hypoperfusion, diuretics, contrast).
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins
  - Renal dosing of meds
  - Nephrology consult if worsens

### 4. Obesity / Prediabetes
- **BMI:** 28.9 on admission (down from baseline 30+ per PCP)
- **Plan:**
  - Diabetic diet, glucose monitoring
  - Endocrine consult, consider metformin if glycemic control worsens
  - Encourage weight loss, nutritionist referral

### 5. Laceration of Right Foot
- **Course:** Superficial, cleaned and closed in ED. No signs of infection.
- **Plan:**
  - Daily wound checks, topical abx
  - PT/OT for mobility

### 6. Other Issues
- DVT prophylaxis: SCDs, LMWH (held when platelets <100k)
- Stress ulcer prophylaxis: pantoprazole
- Pain: naproxen PRN, acetaminophen
- VTE risk: monitor, mechanical prophylaxis

PATIENT NAME: Grimes, Haywood
MRN: 001239487
DOB: 06/30/1924 (Age 99)
SEX: Male
ADMISSION DATE: 04/12/2024
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Dr. S. Becker, MD, Cardiology
CONSULTANTS: Cardiology, Nephrology, Oncology, Pulmonology

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Haywood Grimes is a 99-year-old male with a history of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic sinusitis, prediabetes, anemia, osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, prostate neoplasm/carcinoma in situ, active tobacco use, and prior orthopedic injuries, presenting from home with 3 weeks of worsening dyspnea, PND, and 2-pillow orthopnea. He also notes decreased appetite, 3.5 kg weight gain, and mild confusion. He was on maximal medical therapy for heart failure but did not improve. On arrival, he was hypotensive, tachypneic, and hypoxic. CXR revealed pulmonary edema. NT-proBNP markedly elevated. Echo showed LVEF 28%. He developed cardiogenic shock on hospital day 2 with rising lactate and oliguria, requiring ICU transfer. Temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed for hemodynamic support. Complicated course included acute kidney injury, persistent volume overload, and delirium.

Day 3-7: Improved hemodynamics, weaned off pressors. Developed AKI (Cr peaked at 2.1), nephrology consulted. Delirium, likely multifactorial; haloperidol started. Persistent hypervolemia, continued diuresis, daily weights.
Day 8-12: Gradual improvement, Impella removed day 10. Ongoing diuresis, transitioned to oral meds. Mental status improved. Evaluated by PT/OT for deconditioning.

PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN:

1. **Cardiogenic Shock secondary to acute on chronic decompensated HFrEF**
   - Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support (HD2-10)
   - IV heparin for device
   - IV lasix, uptitrated for diuresis
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os
   - Transitioned to oral heart failure regimen as tolerated
   - Plan: Continue guideline-directed therapy, monitor for arrhythmia, wean diuretics, consider hospice if further decompensation

2. **Acute Kidney Injury (on CKD 3a)**
   - Likely pre-renal, multifactorial (low perfusion, CHF, nephrotoxic exposures)
   - Monitored UOP, daily BMP
   - Avoided nephrotoxic agents
   - Nephrology consulted
   - Renal function improved with volume management

3. **Delirium (multifactorial)**
   - Likely due to critical illness, device, metabolic derangements
   - Haloperidol PRN, sleep-wake cycle optimization
   - Reoriented by staff and family

4. **Volume Overload**
   - Diuretics (IV then PO)
   - Monitored electrolytes, replaced K+/Mg++ as needed

5. **Chronic Anemia**
   - Monitored CBC, no transfusion required
   - Workup consistent with chronic disease

6. **Chronic Sinusitis**
   - Supportive care, no acute infection

7. **Prostate Neoplasm (on leuprolide and docetaxel)**
   - Oncology aware
   - PSA stable; no new GU symptoms

8. **Osteoporosis**
   - Fall precautions, PT/OT
   - Calcium/Vitamin D supplementation

9. **Nicotine Dependence**
   - 24hr patch continued
   - Counseling offered

10. **Hyperlipidemia**
   - Continue statin

11. **Deconditioning**
   - Early mobilization as tolerated
   - PT/OT evaluation

DISPOSITION:
- Stable for transfer to SNF for rehab and continued medical management

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
- Metoprolol succinate 100mg PO QD
- Lasix 40mg PO QAM
- Simvastatin 10mg PO QHS
- Acetaminophen 325mg PO PRN

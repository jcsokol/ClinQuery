---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patient Name: Normand Zemlak       MRN: 00284913
DOB: 10/27/1921 (Age: 102)         Sex: Male
Admit Date: 2024-05-12 14:07       Attending: Dr. J. Carnes
Admitting Service: ICU - Cardiology
Primary Language: English

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath, orthopnea, lower extremity edema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Normand Zemlak is a 102-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (type 2), CKD stage 1, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic sinusitis, prostate neoplasm (s/p leuprolide and docetaxel), and anemia who presented to the ED with acute-on-chronic dyspnea and chest discomfort. In the ED, he was found to be hypotensive (BP 86/53), tachycardic (HR 112), with evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR and elevated troponin. He was admitted to the ICU for management of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) with cardiogenic shock.

Due to progressive hypotension and evidence of end-organ dysfunction (AKI, rising lactate, altered mental status), a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed emergently on hospital day 1. He was intubated for airway protection and started on norepinephrine and dobutamine with improvement in hemodynamics.

ICU HOSPITAL COURSE:

HD 0: Admitted from ED with ADHF, shock. Started on BiPAP, IV furosemide, nitroglycerin drip. Worsening hypotension, lactic acidosis (lactate 4.8), oliguria. Intubated for hypoxemia and mental status changes. Vasopressors started.

HD 1: Ongoing hemodynamic instability (MAP <60 despite norepi/dobutamine). Bedside echo: severely reduced LVEF (~20%), global hypokinesis, moderate MR, IVC plethoric. Emergent left-sided Impella CP placed, good flows achieved. Vasopressors titrated down, some improvement in urine output.

HD 2: Labs improved, lactate normalizing. Still on Impella, low-dose pressors. Extubation attempted but failed due to agitation and hypercapnia. Diuresis continued. AKI improving. Cardiac markers trending down.

HD 3: Stable on Impella, pressors off. Successfully extubated to high-flow nasal cannula. Physical therapy, nutrition consults. Impella wean trial started.

HD 4: Impella removed after successful wean. Mild delirium, but hemodynamics stable off support. Transferred to stepdown unit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASSESSMENT & PLAN (Problem-Based):

1. **Cardiogenic Shock / ADHF, s/p Impella**
   - Decompensated HF, likely ischemic + hypertensive heart disease
   - Managed with pressors, temporary LV support (Impella CP)
   - Now off support, weaning diuretics, continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)
   - Cardiology to follow for advanced therapies vs. palliative options

2. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**
   - Insulin regimen adjusted for AKI
   - Hold metformin while GFR <30
   - Fingersticks q6h, sliding scale insulin
   - Endocrine consult

3. **Chronic Kidney Disease, AKI (resolving)**
   - Pre-renal, multifactorial (hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents)
   - Monitor daily labs, strict I/Os
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal dosing

4. **Anemia (chronic, multifactorial)**
   - Hgb trending down, likely dilutional + CKD/chemo-induced
   - Monitor CBC, consider ESA if needed

5. **Prostate Cancer**
   - s/p leuprolide, docetaxel
   - Oncology to resume outpatient therapy as tolerated

6. **Hypertension**
   - Off antihypertensives during shock, now resuming low-dose HCTZ as tolerated

7. **Chronic Sinusitis**
   - Supportive care, ENT consult if recurrent infections

8. **Delirium/agitation**
   - Likely multifactorial (ICU stay, metabolic, infection)
   - Reorientation, minimize sedatives

9. **Pressure Ulcer, sacrum (stage 1)**
   - Wound care, pressure offloading

10. **Other**
    - DVT prophylaxis (SCDs, heparin)
    - Physical therapy/early mobilization
    - Advanced care planning discussion with family

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCHARGE PLANNING:
- Anticipate transfer to rehab after stepdown
- Close follow-up: Cardiology, Nephrology, Endocrinology, Oncology, PCP
- Home meds to be reconciled at discharge

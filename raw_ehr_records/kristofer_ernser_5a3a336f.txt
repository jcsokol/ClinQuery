### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
“Crushing chest pain, shortness of breath.”

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Kristofer Ernser is a 60-year-old male with prediabetes, chronic anemia, osteoarthritis (hip), and recent URI symptoms who presented to the ED with acute-onset substernal chest pain radiating to the left shoulder, associated with diaphoresis and severe SOB. EMS found him hypotensive, tachycardic, and in respiratory distress. Initial ECG showed anterior STEMI. He was emergently taken to the cath lab for PCI. He developed profound cardiogenic shock during PCI, requiring norepinephrine and subsequently was placed on a temporary left-sided Impella CP heart pump for hemodynamic support. He was transferred to the ICU for ongoing management.

Hospital course has been complicated by persistent heart failure, AKI (now improving), anemia requiring transfusion, and superimposed bacterial sinusitis.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

1. **Cardiogenic shock s/p STEMI, Impella support**  
   - Presented in profound shock, required Impella for 5 days, now off pressors, hemodynamics stable  
   - Continue GDMT for HF (metoprolol, lisinopril started)  
   - Echo today: LVEF 27%, improved  
   - Monitor for arrhythmias  
   - Cardiology following

2. **Acute decompensated heart failure**  
   - Strict I/O, daily weights  
   - Continue gentle diuresis (IV furosemide)  
   - Electrolyte monitoring  
   - BNP trending down

3. **Acute kidney injury (improving)**  
   - Likely secondary to hypoperfusion  
   - Renal function improving with hemodynamic recovery  
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, monitor labs

4. **Anemia**  
   - Baseline chronic, worsened by acute illness/hemolysis  
   - 1 unit PRBC transfused on 4/8  
   - Hgb now stable >12  
   - Monitor for GI loss

5. **Acute bacterial sinusitis**  
   - Ceftriaxone IV x5d, now PO Augmentin  
   - Symptomatic improvement  
   - No abscess on CT

6. **Osteoarthritis (hip)**  
   - Resume acetaminophen, naproxen as needed  
   - PT consult, early mobilization

7. **Prediabetes**  
   - Fasting glucoses normal, A1c 6.2%  
   - Endocrine to follow up as outpatient

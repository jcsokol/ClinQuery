### **History of Present Illness**

Lorri Barton is a 110-year-old female with a history of advanced Alzheimer’s dementia, coronary artery disease, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, obesity, and osteoarthritis who presented to the ED from her skilled nursing facility with acute-onset chest pain, confusion, and dyspnea. She was found to be hypotensive (BP 78/54), tachycardic (HR 119), and hypoxic (SpO₂ 88% on room air). Initial ECG showed ST depressions in lateral leads; troponin was elevated. She was transferred to the ICU for cardiogenic shock.

Despite stabilization with pressors and diuresis, the patient’s shock persisted. She underwent emergent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for temporary circulatory support. She has remained intubated and sedated, with intermittent episodes of myoclonus and altered mental status.

### **Hospital Course (MICU Days 1–7)**

- **Day 1:** Admitted with cardiogenic shock. Intubated for airway protection. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine. Impella CP placed via femoral approach.  
- **Day 2:** Remained hemodynamically unstable. Troponin peaked at 14.4 ng/mL. Lactate 6.2 mmol/L. Transient atrial fibrillation.  
- **Day 3:** Improved MAP (>65 mmHg), weaning off norepinephrine. Impella flows 3.2 L/min. Mild AKI (Cr 1.8).  
- **Day 4:** Developed fever (Tmax 38.6°C), WBC 13.2. CXR: new RLL infiltrate. Started on vancomycin/cefepime.  
- **Day 5:** Impella support ongoing. Echo: LVEF 22%. NT-proBNP 9,400.  
- **Day 6:** Reduced sedation, attempted spontaneous breathing trial—failed due to tachypnea.  
- **Day 7:** Impella weaned and explanted. Remains on low-dose dobutamine.

### **Problem-Based Assessment & Plan**

#### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, s/p STEMI, Impella CP placement**
   - Day 1–7: Managed with vasopressors, inotropes, and Impella support; now weaning off support.
   - Echo: LVEF remains severely reduced.
   - Plan: Continue hemodynamic monitoring, titrate dobutamine, consider transition to palliative care if no further improvement.

#### 2. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
   - Intubated, on mechanical ventilation.
   - Failed SBT on day 6.
   - Plan: Continue lung-protective ventilation, daily SBTs, pulmonary hygiene, monitor for VAP.

#### 3. **Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia**
   - Fever, leukocytosis, new infiltrate.
   - Plan: Continue vancomycin/cefepime, monitor cultures, de-escalate if able.

#### 4. **Acute Kidney Injury (Stage 1)**
   - Likely multifactorial: shock, nephrotoxins, hypoperfusion.
   - Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, optimize volume status.

#### 5. **Alzheimer’s Dementia**
   - Profound baseline cognitive impairment.
   - Plan: Continue donepezil; goals-of-care discussion with family ongoing.

#### 6. **Seizure Disorder**
   - Intermittent myoclonus, no witnessed seizures.
   - Plan: EEG pending, continue seizure precautions, monitor for further events.

#### 7. **Coronary Artery Disease**
   - On statin, antiplatelet.
   - Plan: Continue secondary prevention meds as able.

#### 8. **Obesity, Osteoarthritis, Osteoporosis**
   - At baseline, not a focus of acute management.
   - Plan: DVT prophylaxis, repositioning, calcium/vitamin D repletion.

#### 9. **Pain/Delirium/Sedation**
   - On fentanyl, midazolam for comfort.
   - Attempt to minimize sedation as tolerated.

#### 10. **Other**
   - Code status: Full, but goals-of-care discussion ongoing.
   - PT/OT consult for mobility as able.

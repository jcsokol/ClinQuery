# CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Shortness of breath, chest pain, progressive lower extremity edema.

# HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Horacio Magaña is a 61-year-old male with PMH including prediabetes, anemia, chronic tobacco use, and recent acute bronchitis who was admitted 5 days ago for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and decompensated heart failure. He presented with 1 week of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, and 2 days of pleuritic chest pain. On arrival, he was tachypneic, hypoxic, and hypotensive with evidence of volume overload and new-onset atrial fibrillation with RVR.

Despite initial medical management (IV diuresis, BiPAP, rate control, and empiric antibiotics for possible pneumonia), he developed worsening hypotension, rising lactate, and evidence of cardiogenic shock with acute kidney injury. He was transferred to the MICU and required vasopressor support (norepinephrine, dobutamine). Echo showed severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, and moderate MR. Given persistent shock, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day #2 for temporary mechanical circulatory support.

Since device placement, he has shown gradual improvement. Vasopressors were weaned off by HD #4, and urine output improved. He remains on IV diuresis and low-dose milrinone. Oxygen requirements have decreased; he is now on 3L NC. Renal function is trending up. He has had intermittent fevers, likely related to device but cultures remain negative. He continues to experience mild chest discomfort, but no new symptoms.

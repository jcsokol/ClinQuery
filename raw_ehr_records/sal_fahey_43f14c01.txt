### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Sal Fahey is a 113-year-old male with an extensive cardiovascular and metabolic history including chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes (on insulin and metformin), prediabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 (baseline Cr ~2.1, now acutely worsened), anemia, chronic sinusitis, metabolic syndrome, and significant tobacco usage. He presented to the ED with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema, and was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with evidence of cardiogenic shock. Initial workup revealed hypotension (SBP 74 mmHg), rising creatinine, and lactic acidosis. Despite IV diuresis and inotropic support, he required placement of a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support on hospital day 2. He has remained in the cardiac ICU with a complicated hospital course, including AKI, ongoing volume overload, and intermittent episodes of hypoglycemia.

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY
- **Day 1:** Admitted with acute CHF exacerbation, cardiogenic shock. Started on IV furosemide, dobutamine, vasopressors.  
- **Day 2:** Persistent hypotension and low cardiac index. Temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placed. Transient improvement in end-organ perfusion.
- **Day 3-6:** Gradual uptitration of diuretics, slow improvement in volume status. Renal function fluctuating, intermittent need for CVVH considered but not initiated. Blood glucose labile, multiple episodes of hypoglycemia requiring D50.
- **Day 7:** Temporary LVAD weaning trial successful. Device removed.
- **Day 8-10:** Stabilizing, transitioned to oral meds, stepped down from ICU to telemetry.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

1. **Acute decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock (HFrEF)**
   - Likely precipitated by dietary indiscretion, nonadherence, and underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   - Required temporary LVAD (Impella) for 5 days; weaned off successfully.
   - Now off vasopressors, tolerating oral afterload reduction.
   - **Plan:** Continue aggressive diuresis, uptitrate GDMT, daily weights, strict I/O, cardiac rehab consult, telemetry, repeat echo prior to discharge.

2. **AKI on CKD (baseline Cr 2.1, peak 5.2, now improving)**
   - Likely multifactorial: low output, cardiorenal syndrome, possible contrast nephropathy.
   - **Plan:** Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, nephrology following, adjust meds for renal dosing, consider outpatient nephrology f/u.

3. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**
   - Labile glucose, multiple hypoglycemic events while NPO and on insulin.
   - **Plan:** Endocrine to adjust insulin regimen, continue metformin if renal function allows, monitor FSBS q4h, diabetic diet.

4. **Chronic anemia (baseline Hgb ~11, nadir 9.7)**
   - Stable, likely anemia of chronic disease.
   - **Plan:** Monitor, iron studies, B12/folate repletion, no transfusion needed unless symptomatic.

5. **Chronic sinusitis**
   - Mild congestion, no acute infection.
   - **Plan:** Continue nasal steroids, ENT outpatient f/u.

6. **Hypertriglyceridemia / Metabolic syndrome**
   - On statin at home, mild elevation.
   - **Plan:** Resume statin, dietary counseling.

7. **Tobacco use disorder**
   - On nicotine patch, continues to express interest in quitting.
   - **Plan:** Continue patch, offer cessation counseling.

8. **Secondary prevention**
   - Antiplatelet therapy, statin, pneumococcal and influenza vaccines prior to discharge.

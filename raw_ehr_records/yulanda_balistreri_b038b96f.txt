## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Altered mental status and hypotension at home, brought in by EMS.

---

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

58F with h/o poorly controlled HTN, obesity (BMI ~30), recent E. coli UTI on nitrofurantoin, and remote hx of drug overdose, presenting after being found obtunded at home. EMS noted HR 52, BP 84/50, O2 92% on RA. Patient was intubated for airway protection. In ED, she was found to be in cardiogenic shock with evidence of acute pulmonary edema (CXR: bibasilar infiltrates, enlarged cardiac silhouette). Initial echo: LVEF ~15%, global hypokinesis. Started on norepinephrine + dobutamine. Due to persistent hypoperfusion and rising lactate, Impella CP placed by cardiology for temporary mechanical circulatory support. 

Course complicated by AKI, mild transaminitis, and delirium. On day 3, developed fever, positive urine culture for ESBL E. coli. Weaned off Impella on day 5 as LVEF improved to 32%. Extubated on day 6.

## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

- Admitted in cardiogenic shock, required pressors and Impella CP placement

- Weaned off Impella and pressors by day 5
- Extubated, mental status baseline
- Started on GDMT for new HFrEF

---

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, New HFrEF (EF 15–32%)**  
- Likely ischemic vs. non-ischemic, no prior known cardiac dz  
- Impella CP placed for temporary support; now weaned, stable  
- Continue GDMT: low-dose carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone  
- Cardiac cath deferred (no ongoing ischemia, troponin stable, pt stable)  
- Cardiac MRI pending outpatient  
- Daily weights, fluid restriction, monitor for recurrence

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**  
- Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic meds  
- Cr improved to baseline, continue to monitor  
- Avoid NSAIDs, adjust renally cleared meds

**3. ESBL E. coli UTI**  
- Treated with IV meropenem x 5d, now PO  
- Foley removed, no further fevers  
- ID following

**4. Obesity/HTN**  
- Restarted home atenolol/chlorthalidone  
- Encourage low-salt diet, weight loss counseling

**5. Delirium (resolved)**  
- Likely multifactorial, resolved  
- Sleep hygiene, minimize nighttime disruptions

**6. Remote Drug Overdose, Social Concerns**  
- Psychiatry consulted, no acute suicidality  
- Social work following for safe d/c plan

**7. Other**  
- Healing forearm laceration, wound care prn  
- Sinusitis: supportive care

**Disposition:**  
- Anticipate transfer to stepdown within 24h, then home with VNA  
- Close cardiology & PCP follow-up

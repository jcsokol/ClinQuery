### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Progressive dyspnea, hypotension, and acute decompensated heart failure.

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**HPI:**  
Mr. Ernesto Rodríguez is a 111-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), ischemic stroke (remote), obesity, prostate cancer (on leuprolide, docetaxel), and chronic sinusitis, who presented with 2 days of worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. On arrival to the ED, he was tachycardic (AFib with RVR), hypotensive to 80s/50s, and hypoxic to 88% on room air. CXR: bilateral pulmonary edema. Echo: severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF 15%), moderate MR, dilated LA, RV mild dysfunction. Troponin I mildly elevated, BNP 2400.  

He was admitted to the ICU for acute decompensated heart failure, rapidly progressing to cardiogenic shock despite IV diuresis, vasopressors, and antiarrhythmics. After multidisciplinary discussion and in the setting of multi-organ hypoperfusion, a decision was made to place a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2. He required temporary mechanical support for 7 days, with gradual improvement in end-organ function and hemodynamics. The device was weaned and explanted on day 9.  

Course was complicated by transient AKI (Cr peaked at 2.4), hemolysis (LDH up), supratherapeutic INR (warfarin), and intermittent delirium. Oncology and Urology consulted for prostate cancer management; no acute intervention required.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (EF 15%, AFib, prior MI)**
   - Required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for 7 days, explanted on day 9.
   - On IV furosemide, milrinone (weaned off), norepinephrine (weaned off HD 5).
   - Gradual improvement in renal and hepatic perfusion, normalization of lactate.
   - Plan: Continue PO diuresis, optimize HF meds (add low-dose beta-blocker if hemodynamics allow), daily weights, fluid restriction.
   - Cardiology to continue to follow.

**2. Atrial Fibrillation (chronic, on warfarin)**
   - Rate controlled on verapamil and digoxin.
   - Warfarin held for supratherapeutic INR; now resumed at lower dose.
   - Monitor for bleeding, daily INR.

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, diuretics, hemolysis)**
   - Cr peaked at 2.4, now trending down (last 1.03).
   - No need for RRT.
   - Maintain euvolemia, avoid nephrotoxins.

**4. Prostate Cancer (on ADT, chemo)**
   - No acute issues, last docetaxel cycle 3 weeks ago.
   - Leuprolide on schedule.
   - Urology/Onc: continue current plan.

**5. Obesity**
   - BMI 28 (down from 30).
   - Nutritional consult: low-sodium, renal diet.

**6. Chronic Sinusitis / Viral Sinusitis**
   - No active infection.
   - ENT: No intervention required.

**7. Stroke (remote, no deficit)**
   - On anticoagulation for AFib.
   - No new neuro findings.

**8. Delirium (ICU, multifactorial)**
   - Resolved with re-orientation, sleep hygiene.
   - No antipsychotics needed.

**9. Anemia / Thrombocytopenia**
   - Mild, likely dilutional and secondary to device.
   - Monitor CBC.

**10. Hemolysis (mechanical, from LVAD)**
   - LDH elevated during support, resolved post-explant.
   - Monitor haptoglobin, retic if recurrence.

**11. DVT Prophylaxis**
   - SCDs, early ambulation, resume warfarin.

**12. Code Status**
   - Full code, discussed with family. Patient wishes for all life-prolonging measures.

---

**Discharge Planning:**  
- Anticipate step-down to telemetry in 1-2 days, then acute rehab.
- Extensive education: HF self-care, medication adherence, INR monitoring.
- Follow-up: Cardiology, Oncology, Urology, PCP.

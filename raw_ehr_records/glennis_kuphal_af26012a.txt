**Patient Name:** Glennis Kuphal  
**MRN:** 0102456  
**DOB:** 04/18/2000 (24 years old)  
**Sex:** Female  
**Admitting Service:** MICU  
**Attending:** Dr. R. Lin  
**Date of Admission:** 2024-06-18  
**Date of Note:** 2024-06-22  
**Hospital Day:** 4  

---

### **Chief Complaint**

Shortness of breath, chest pain, and hypotension.

---

### **History of Present Illness**

Glennis Kuphal is a 24-year-old female with PMHx significant for hypertension, viral sinusitis, normal pregnancy (remote, G1P1 2022), and remote rib fracture, presenting to the ED with 3 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and pleuritic chest pain. She was initially evaluated for viral sinusitis and treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Shortly after, she developed progressive fatigue and lower extremity edema. In the ED, she was found to be hypotensive (SBP 80s), tachycardic, and hypoxic on room air (SpO2 87%).

She rapidly decompensated with evidence of cardiogenic shock. Point-of-care echo showed severely reduced LVEF (~15%) with global hypokinesis, no pericardial effusion. She was transferred to the MICU for management of shock and required the placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support. She has since stabilized on inotropes and is being weaned from mechanical support.

### **Hospital Course (Summary)**

- **HD1:** Admitted with acute decompensated heart failure and shock. Started on inotropes (dobutamine), norepinephrine. Intubated for hypoxia. Impella CP placed.
- **HD2:** Hemodynamics improving, extubated to nasal cannula. Echo: LVEF 18%.
- **HD3:** Weaning off vasoactives. Impella flows decreased to P2. Renal function stable.  
- **HD4:** Impella explanted this morning. Monitoring for rebound shock.

- **CXR (HD2):** Improved vascular congestion

---

### **Assessment & Plan**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (likely myocarditis, viral prodrome):**  
 - Etiology likely viral myocarditis (recent URI, sinusitis, rapid decompensation).
 - Required Impella for hemodynamic support, now explanted.
 - Plan: Monitor for recurrent shock, daily echo, trend troponin/BNP, continue inotropes PRN, wean O2.

**2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure:**  
 - LVEF severely reduced, volume overload on admission.
 - Diuresis with IV furosemide, strict I/O, sodium restriction.
 - Continue telemetry, daily weights, titrate HF meds as tolerated.

**3. Recent Viral Sinusitis:**  
 - Treated with Augmentin, symptoms improved.
 - No evidence of superimposed bacterial infection.

**4. Hypertension:**  
 - Held outpatient HCTZ on admission due to hypotension.
 - To resume after hemodynamic stability achieved.

**5. Medication Management:**  
 - OCPs (Natazia, Yaz) held during acute illness (hypercoagulability risk).
   - Plan to re-evaluate prior to discharge.
 - Ibuprofen PRN for mild rib pain (avoid NSAIDs if renal function worsens).

**6. VTE Prophylaxis:**  
 - On heparin SQ.

**7. Nutrition:**  
 - Cardiac diet, salt restriction.

**8. Psychosocial:**  
 - Patient anxious about prognosis, supportive counseling provided.

**9. Disposition:**  
 - Continue ICU monitoring.
   - Step-down to telemetry when stable.
   - Anticipate prolonged recovery.

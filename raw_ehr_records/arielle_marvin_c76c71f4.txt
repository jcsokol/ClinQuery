### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Shortness of breath, chest pressure, and lower extremity swelling x 1 week.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
74F with PMHx of HTN, obesity, HLD, and chronic sinusitis who presented to the ED with acute-on-chronic SOB, orthopnea, and LE edema. Pt was initially hypertensive (BP 172/97) and tachycardic (HR 116), hypoxic to 88% on RA. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Troponin mildly elevated (0.06 → 0.11). Echo in ED revealed new LVEF 15% (baseline 50% 2y prior), global hypokinesis, moderate MR. On arrival to MICU, patient acutely decompensated into cardiogenic shock (MAP 58, cool extremities, lactate 3.8). Required vasopressors and emergent placement of a percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP). Subsequently stabilized but remains on inotropes and mechanical support.

## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**Day 0 (3/21):**  
- ED presentation with acute SOB, hypoxia, flash pulm edema, mild troponin leak
- Started on IV furosemide, BiPAP, transferred to MICU
- Cardiac ECHO: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, mod MR
- Cardiac markers uptrending, lactic acidosis
- Developed hypotension refractory to fluids, started on norepinephrine & dobutamine
- Emergent Impella CP placed by cardiology at bedside

**Day 1:**  
- Hemodynamics improved on Impella + inotropes
- Extubated to high-flow nasal cannula
- Creatinine uptrending (AKI likely cardiorenal)
- Diuresed, strict I/Os, started low-dose spironolactone
- Serial labs, echo, and neuro checks

**Day 2:**  
- Improved oxygenation, off pressors
- Still requiring Impella support (low native cardiac output)
- Renal function plateaued, urine output stable
- Troponin peaked, then trending down
- Repeat echo: LVEF up to 22%, still severely reduced

**Day 3:**  
- Attempted Impella wean, MAP dropped, re-escalated support
- Multidisciplinary discussion (Heart Failure, Cardiology, Ethics): not a candidate for durable LVAD or transplant due to age/comorbidities
- Goals of care discussion with patient/family

**Day 4-5:**  
- Gradual improvement, transitioned off inotropes
- Weaned off Impella on day 5, device explanted at bedside
- Renal function improving, transitioned to PO diuretics
- Mobilizing with PT, appetite returning

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock (Acute Decompensated HFrEF)
- Etiology: Presumed ischemic (troponin leak, new global LV dysfunction)
- Required Impella CP for circulatory support, dobutamine/norepinephrine for MAP goals
- Now off mechanical/inotropic support, MAP stable >70
- Plan: Continue gentle diuresis, optimize GDMT as tolerated, monitor for arrhythmias, daily weights, strict I/Os, serial TTEs

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (Cardiorenal Syndrome)
- Baseline Cr 1.1, peaked at 2.9, now improved to 1.4
- Etiology: low cardiac output, pre-renal
- Now diuresing, off pressors, urine output adequate
- Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust diuretics as needed

### 3. Heart Failure with Reduced EF (HFrEF, new dx)
- LVEF 15% → 22% → 30% (latest TTE)
- Not a candidate for transplant or durable LVAD
- Plan: Initiate low-dose BB/ACEi/aldactone as tolerated, fluid restriction

### 4. Hypertension/Hyperlipidemia
- Restarted home antihypertensives and statin
- Plan: Aggressive risk factor modification, dietary consult

### 5. Obesity
- Weight trending down (likely fluid loss)
- Plan: Dietician consult, PT/OT for mobility

### 6. Viral sinusitis (remote)
- No current symptoms, continue supportive care

### 7. Delirium (hospital-acquired, resolved)
- No active confusion, reoriented

### 8. Pain (chest wall, mild)
- Likely related to Impella site, managed with Tylenol

---

## DISCHARGE PLANNING
- Anticipate transfer to step-down in 24-48h
- HF clinic f/u, outpatient TTE, home health referral
- Continue cardiac rehab/PT

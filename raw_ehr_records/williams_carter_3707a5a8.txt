# ICU Progress Note – Day 5

---

## History of Present Illness

Williams Carter is a 21-year-old male with a PMH significant for obesity (BMI 37), chronic sinusitis, ADHD (on atomoxetine), and recent streptococcal pharyngitis (treated with penicillin). He presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and subjective fevers. On arrival, he was tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic, with a blood pressure of 88/54 mmHg. CXR revealed pulmonary edema; bedside echo showed severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF ~10%) with global hypokinesis, no significant valvular abnormalities, and mild RV dysfunction. Troponin was elevated; BNP markedly increased. He was admitted to the ICU for acute decompensated heart failure, likely secondary to viral myocarditis.

Due to persistent hypotension and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion despite escalating inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone), a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 2 for circulatory support. He subsequently stabilized hemodynamically and has been weaning off pressors.

## Hospital Course Summary

- **Day 1:** Admitted to ICU. Initial labs notable for leukocytosis, elevated troponin, transaminitis, AKI (Cr 1.8 from baseline 0.9). Required high-flow O2, started on dobutamine and norepinephrine.
- **Day 2:** Persistent shock, worsening lactate, oliguria. Impella CP placed. Vasopressors/inotropes titrated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics started for possible sepsis.
- **Day 3:** Improved mentation, urine output. Lactate trending down. Reduced norepi. Echo: Impella flow 3.5 L/min, LV unloading adequate.
- **Day 4:** Off pressors, weaning Impella. Diuresis initiated with IV furosemide. LFTs improving. 
- **Day 5:** Tolerating Impella wean. Renal and hepatic function improving. Transferred to step-down pending Impella explant.

## Active Problems

1. **Acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock (likely viral myocarditis)**
2. **Obesity (BMI 37)**
3. **Acute kidney injury (multifactorial: low flow, nephrotoxic agents)**
4. **Transaminitis secondary to shock liver**
5. **Chronic sinusitis**
6. **Streptococcal pharyngitis (recent, completed antibiotics)**
7. **ADHD (on atomoxetine)**
8. **Anxiety/agitation (ICU-related)**
9. **Risk for nosocomial infection**
10. **Pain (mild, intermittent)**

## Assessment and Plan

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock s/p Impella CP  
- Etiology: Suspected viral myocarditis vs. stress-induced cardiomyopathy
- Continue Impella support, daily device checks
- Wean inotropes as tolerated
- Serial TTE to assess recovery
- Monitor for device complications (hemolysis, limb ischemia, infection)
- Cardiology following

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury  
- Likely multifactorial: pre-renal (low flow), nephrotoxins
- Renal function improving w/ hemodynamic support
- Avoid nephrotoxic agents
- Monitor urine output, daily BMP

### 3. Transaminitis  
- Shock liver pattern (AST/ALT > 1000 on day 2, now improving)
- Trending LFTs daily
- No evidence of viral hepatitis

### 4. Obesity  
- Dietician consult
- DVT prophylaxis (SQ heparin, SCDs)
- Monitor for OSA

### 5. Chronic Sinusitis  
- No acute symptoms, continue outpatient management

### 6. ADHD  
- Atomoxetine held during acute illness, resume when stable

### 7. Anxiety/Agitation  
- ICU delirium precautions, sleep hygiene
- PRN lorazepam for agitation

### 8. Infection Risk  
- Daily CBC, monitor for fever
- Empiric abx (cefepime, vanc) stopped after 48h, negative cultures

### 9. Pain  
- Mild, managed with acetaminophen

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**HPI:**  
71-year-old F with PMH significant for chronic sinusitis, prediabetes, anemia, prior ischemic stroke (2015, with residual mild right-sided weakness), presented to OSH 4/11/24 with acute onset chest pain, SOB, and diaphoresis. Initial ECG showed anterior STEMI. Emergent transfer to our facility for higher level of care after she became hypotensive (SBP 70s) and developed worsening hypoxia. She was intubated in the ED for hypoxic respiratory failure. Echo at admission: LVEF 15%, severe global hypokinesis, moderate MR. Decision made to place a percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support. 

She had a complicated ICU course, including AKI (resolved), mild transaminitis, and anemia requiring transfusion. She was successfully weaned off Impella on HD#5, extubated on HD#6, and transferred to the stepdown unit on HD#8.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, s/p Anterior STEMI, severe LV dysfunction (LVEF 15%)**  
- Impella CP placed 4/12/24 for hemodynamic support  
- Vasopressors (norepinephrine) weaned by HD#5  
- Serial TTEs: LVEF improved to 25% by HD#8  
- Cardiology following, plan GDMT initiation (BB, ACEi, MRA as tolerated)  
- Cardiac rehab consult placed  
- Continue telemetry, daily weights, strict I&O

**2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, s/p Intubation, now extubated**  
- Intubated for 5 days, successfully extubated HD#6  
- CXR: resolving pulmonary edema  
- Incentive spirometry, pulmonary toilet  
- Sats >94% RA  
- Monitor for aspiration given prior stroke hx

**3. Anemia (baseline and acute on chronic), s/p 2U PRBCs**  
- Hgb nadir 7.2 g/dL (HD#2)  
- Likely multifactorial: acute blood loss (access site), chronic anemia of CKD/possible iron deficiency  
- Iron studies pending  
- No further transfusions needed after HD#3  
- F/u GI for colonoscopy as outpatient

**4. AKI on CKD (baseline Cr ~1.0, peak 2.1, improved to 1.2)**  
- Likely multifactorial: pre-renal (shock), contrast-induced  
- Improved with volume resuscitation, off pressors  
- Strict I&O, avoid nephrotoxins  
- Renal dosing for all meds

**5. Prediabetes**  
- Glucose controlled throughout admission (80-160 mg/dL)  
- A1c 6.1%  
- D/C metformin for now, f/u in clinic  
- Diabetic diet, diabetes educator consult

**6. Chronic Sinusitis**  
- No acute exacerbation  
- ENT to follow as outpatient

**7. Hx Ischemic Stroke (2015), right-sided weakness**  
- No new neuro deficits  
- PT/OT involved, baseline function at discharge  
- DVT ppx with heparin s/c

**8. Hyperlipidemia**  
- LDL 89 mg/dL  
- Continue atorvastatin 40 mg qHS

**9. Social/Disposition**  
- Lives alone, daughter nearby  
- Needs SNF for rehab, case management involved  
- Code: full

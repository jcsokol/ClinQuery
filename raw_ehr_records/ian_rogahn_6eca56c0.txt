# Admission H&P

**Chief Complaint:**  
Worsening shortness of breath, chest tightness, and productive cough

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. Rogahn is a 43-year-old male with a past medical history significant for acute bronchitis (onset 2 weeks ago), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented to the ED with 4 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigue. He also reports a persistent productive cough with yellow sputum. He denied fever, chills, or hemoptysis. On arrival, he was tachycardic (HR 112), hypotensive (BP 88/52), and tachypneic (RR 27). He became increasingly hypoxic despite supplemental O2 and developed signs of cardiogenic shock requiring transfer to the ICU.

# ICU Course Summary (05/29 - 06/03)

**Day 1:**  
Admitted to ICU for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and shock. Rapid escalation of O2; started on norepinephrine for hypotension. Bedside echo showed severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, mild LV dilation. Troponin mildly elevated. Started on IV diuretics, broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone/azithromycin), and dobutamine. Despite this, worsening end-organ hypoperfusion (AKI, rising lactate).  

**Day 2:**  
Persistent hypotension and low cardiac output despite escalating inotropes/pressors. Multidisciplinary team decision for placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) at bedside. Device placed without complication. Immediate improvement in MAP and urine output.  

**Day 3-4:**  
Gradual improvement in end-organ function. Weaned off norepinephrine. Cough improved, less dyspneic. Still on Impella support. Serial echoes showed improved LV unloading.  

**Day 5:**  
Impella weaned and removed. Patient stable, transitioned to high-flow nasal cannula. Diuresis continued.  

**Day 6:**  
Steady improvement, off vasopressors/inotropes. Transferred to step-down unit.

# Problem List / Assessment & Plan

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, severe LV systolic dysfunction**  
- Likely secondary to acute myocarditis vs. ischemic insult (troponin rise, no clear STEMI)  
- Required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support  
- Plan: Continue GDMT for HF, monitor volume status, daily echo, wean support as tolerated

**2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**  
- Multifactorial: pulmonary edema (CHF), bronchitis  
- O2 support (initially NRB, then HFNC), diuresis  
- Plan: Continue diuretics, chest physiotherapy, monitor ABGs

**3. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury**  
- Likely pre-renal from poor perfusion  
- Improved with LVAD and diuresis  
- Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds by GFR

**4. Acute Bronchitis**  
- Productive cough, recent URI symptoms  
- Treated empirically with ceftriaxone/azithromycin  
- Plan: Reassess need for abx, sputum cultures pending

**5. Hyperlipidemia**  
- On atorvastatin, continue  
- Plan: Reassess lipid panel prior to discharge

**6. Hypertension**  
- Previously well controlled  
- Hold ACEi/ARB during AKI, resume once stable

**7. Anemia**  
- Mild, likely dilutional/acute illness  
- Follow CBC, transfuse if Hb <7

**8. Electrolyte Disturbances**  
- Mild hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia  
- Correct as needed, monitor daily

**9. Pain**  
- Mild, managed with acetaminophen

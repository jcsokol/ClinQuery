**Epic EHR - Progress Note: ICU Admission**

**Patient:** Omer Parisian  
**MRN:** 0039942-ICU  
**DOB:** 1985-01-09 (Age: 39)  
**Sex:** Male  
**Date of Admission:** 2024-05-21  
**Attending:** Dr. Alexei McTavish  
**Location:** MICU, Bed 4B

---

### **Chief Complaint**
Acute respiratory distress, hypotension, and altered mental status.

---

### **History of Present Illness**
39-year-old male with a past medical history notable for epilepsy (on diazepam), seizure disorder, and prior acute allergic reactions, who presented to the ED after a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure at home. Per family, patient became unresponsive with perioral cyanosis and had a prolonged post-ictal period. EMS noted hypotension (BP 76/45), hypoxemia, and diffuse urticaria. In ED, he developed worsening hypotension, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and was intubated for airway protection. He required escalating vasopressor support and was transferred to the ICU.

Within hours of ICU admission, he developed acute cardiogenic shock refractory to fluids and pressors, with echocardiogram demonstrating severe global LV dysfunction (EF 18%). Due to persistent shock and end-organ hypoperfusion, a percutaneous temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed at bedside.

[EPIC EHR] - INPATIENT PROGRESS NOTE – ICU
====================================================================

PATIENT NAME: Joe Lynch  
MRN: 001276394  
DOB: 1951-05-24 (Age: 72)  
Sex: Male  
Date of Admission: 2024-05-28  
Date of Note: 2024-06-02  
Attending: Dr. R. Feldman  
Consultants: Cardiology, Infectious Disease, Nephrology  
Location: MICU, Bed 4

====================================================================
REASON FOR ADMISSION:
Acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock, requiring temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) placement.

====================================================================
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Mr. Lynch is a 72-year-old male with a background of coronary artery disease (s/p PCI x2), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage III, and osteoarthritis, who presented to the ED with acute-onset dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest pressure. He was found to be hypotensive (SBP 84 mmHg), tachycardic, in respiratory distress, and hypoxic. Troponin was elevated (see labs), BNP 2734 pg/mL. Bedside echo showed severely reduced LVEF (~20%) with global hypokinesis. He rapidly deteriorated with worsening shock and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion (AKI, rising lactate, altered mentation). Pressors (norepinephrine, dobutamine) were started, but he remained unstable and was emergently taken for placement of a temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for mechanical circulatory support.

His hospital course has been complicated by persistent kidney injury, volume overload, and intermittent atrial fibrillation with RVR. He is currently intubated and sedated, on mechanical ventilation, and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (fever on day 2, concern for VAP). No significant bleeding from access sites. No evidence of acute limb ischemia.

====================================================================
PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

1. **Cardiogenic Shock, s/p Impella CP Placement**
   - Etiology: Ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute on chronic.
   - Hemodynamics improved post-device, MAP now >65 mmHg on minimal pressor support.
   - Plan:
     - Continue Impella support, daily device checks, wean as tolerated.
     - Serial ECHO to assess LV function.
     - Continue goal-directed medical therapy for HF as tolerated (hold ACEi for AKI).
     - Daily weights, strict I/O, diuresis as tolerated.
     - Monitor for device-related complications (hemolysis, limb ischemia, infection).

2. **Acute Kidney Injury on CKD III**
   - Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, contrast exposure, diuretics.
   - Last Cr 2.8 mg/dL (baseline 1.6), UOP improved, not oliguric.
   - Plan:
     - Avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal dosing.
     - Monitor lytes and fluid status.
     - Nephrology following, no RRT at this time.

3. **Volume Overload / Respiratory Failure**
   - On mechanical ventilation (FiO2 40%, PEEP 5), CXR: bibasilar infiltrates, pulmonary edema.
   - Negative fluid balance x2 days.
   - Plan:
     - Gentle diuresis with IV furosemide.
     - Daily CXR, ABGs.
     - Spontaneous breathing trial when stable.

4. **Atrial Fibrillation with RVR**
   - Intermittent episodes, rate controlled with IV diltiazem boluses.
   - Plan:
     - Continue telemetry.
     - Resume oral rate control agents when extubated.
     - Anticoagulation held for bleeding risk/device.

5. **Fever, Suspected VAP**
   - T: 38.6C, WBC 13k, CXR: new right lower lobe infiltrate.
   - Plan:
     - Empiric pip/tazo + vancomycin, de-escalate per cultures.
     - Sputum, blood cultures sent.
     - Daily CBC, procalcitonin.

6. **Chronic Med Problems**
   - Hyperlipidemia: statin held for LFTs >3x ULN.
   - Osteoarthritis: acetaminophen PRN, avoid NSAIDs.
   - Chronic sinusitis: not active.
   - Concussion (remote): no acute findings.
   - Home meds reviewed, multiple duplications of simvastatin noted, corrected.

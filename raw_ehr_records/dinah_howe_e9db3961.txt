### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Ms. Dinah Howe is an 86-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, prediabetes, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, and remote miscarriage, who presented to the ED with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigue. She was found to be in acute decompensated heart failure with evidence of cardiogenic shock, requiring ICU admission and subsequently temporary mechanical circulatory support with a left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) on hospital day 2. Her course was complicated by acute kidney injury, transient liver enzyme elevation, and delirium. She was weaned off the pump on day 6 and transferred to the step-down unit on day 9.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock**
- **Assessment:** Severe new-onset HFrEF, likely ischemic, presenting with pulmonary edema, hypotension, multi-organ hypoperfusion. Required MCS for stabilization.
- **Plan:**
  - Impella CP placed, removed after 5 days.
  - IV diuresis, transitioned to oral as tolerated.
  - Strict I/Os, daily weights.
  - TTE post-explant: LVEF 30%.
  - GDMT initiation deferred until stabilized.
  - Cardiology, HF specialist f/u.

### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury (Stage 2, resolving)**
- **Assessment:** Likely pre-renal from low CO, improved with MCS.
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor labs, avoid nephrotoxins.
  - Adjust diuretics to renal function.
  - Renal consult if worsening.

### 3. **Atrial Fibrillation with RVR**
- **Assessment:** New-onset, likely secondary to decompensation.
- **Plan:**
  - Rate control (initially IV metoprolol, now PO).
  - Anticoagulation: Heparin → Apixaban at discharge.
  - TTE to r/o thrombus pre-cardioversion if rhythm control considered.

### 4. **Transaminitis**
- **Assessment:** Likely ischemic hepatitis (“shock liver”), resolved with improved perfusion.
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor LFTs, trending down.
  - No hepatotoxic meds.

### 5. **Delirium**
- **Assessment:** Multifactorial (hypoperfusion, ICU, sleep deprivation).
- **Plan:**
  - Non-pharm measures, minimize restraints.
  - Sleep hygiene, reorientation.
  - No antipsychotics needed.

### 6. **Hypertension/Hyperlipidemia/Prediabetes**
- **Assessment:** Chronic, previously controlled.
- **Plan:**
  - Restart meds as tolerated.
  - Outpatient follow-up for A1c, lipids.

### 7. **Osteoarthritis**
- **Assessment:** Knee pain, mobility limited during ICU stay.
- **Plan:**
  - Resume PT/OT.
  - Avoid NSAIDs (renal risk).
  - Topical agents, acetaminophen.

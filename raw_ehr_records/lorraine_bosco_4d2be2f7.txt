# Admission Note  
**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive SOB, orthopnea, and confusion at home. EMS called by daughter for acute decompensation.

**HPI:**  
Ms. Bosco is a 96-year-old woman with h/o HTN, obesity, epilepsy, prior CVA, anemia, and OA, who presented with acutely worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and confusion. She had 3 days of increasing fatigue, mild cough, and decreased PO intake. No chest pain, palpitations, or recent seizures per daughter. Found hypoxic (SpO₂ 84% RA), tachypneic, BP 88/50 in the field. Intubated for respiratory distress on arrival. Bedside echo in ED showed severely reduced LVEF (15%), global hypokinesis, and LV dilatation. Troponin mildly elevated. Cardiogenic shock suspected; emergently transferred to CICU for inotropes and mechanical support.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension  
- Obesity (BMI 30)  
- Epilepsy, remote single seizure  
- CVA (ischemic, L-sided weakness, now resolved)  
- Anemia (chronic, likely multifactorial)  
- Osteoarthritis, hand  
- Chronic sinusitis  
- Prior miscarriage, blighted ovum, otherwise normal pregnancies  
- Acute bronchitis (remote)  
- Laceration, hand (remote)

**Allergies:** NKDA

**Home Medications:**  
- HCTZ 25 mg daily  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily  
- Ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily  
- Enovid (mestranol/norethynodrel)  
- Naproxen sodium 220 mg prn  
- Acetaminophen/dextromethorphan/doxylamine solution prn

**Social Hx:**  
Lives with daughter, retired teacher. No EtOH, tobacco, or drugs.

**Family Hx:**  
Noncontributory.

# Hospital Course (ICU Summary)  
**Day 1:**  
Admitted in cardiogenic shock, intubated. Started norepinephrine, dobutamine. Echo: LVEF 15%, LV dilated, RV normal, no significant valvular dz. Troponin I 0.34 → 0.29. Lactate 4.2. Worsening end organ perfusion (UOP < 0.3cc/kg/hr, Cr up from baseline 1.3 to 2.1).  
**Day 2:**  
No improvement on inotropes. Cardiology recommended Impella CP placement for LV unloading. Device placed at bedside without complication. Hemodynamics improved (MAP >65, lactate downtrending).  
**Day 3-5:**  
Gradual wean of vasopressors. Extubated on day 4. Impella removed on day 5 after TTE showed LVEF improved to 30%. Mild delirium, resolving.  
**Day 6+:**  
Transitioned to step-down unit. Diuresis with IV furosemide. Renal function improved. Neurology consulted for confusion—no seizure activity. Started on low-dose carvedilol, uptitrated. Physical therapy for deconditioning. Discharge planning initiated.

# Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock, s/p Impella CP  
- Likely acute decompensated heart failure on chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%).  
- Emergent Impella placement, now removed, hemodynamics stabilized.  
- Plan: Continue GDMT (carvedilol, ACEi to start if BP tolerates), daily weights, strict I/O, monitor for arrhythmias, repeat echo in 1 week.

## 2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure  
- Previously undiagnosed severe LV dysfunction, likely ischemic.  
- Plan: Start low-dose ACEi, continue diuresis, titrate beta-blocker. Outpatient cardiology f/u.  
- Monitor for volume overload, renal function.

## 3. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, resolved)  
- AKI on admission (Cr 2.1, baseline 1.3), likely secondary to low perfusion.  
- Improved with restoration of cardiac output; Cr trending toward baseline.  
- Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, maintain euvolemia.

## 4. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure, s/p Intubation/Extubation  
- Intubated for respiratory distress, extubated on day 4.  
- Plan: Incentive spirometry, monitor for reintubation, pulmonary toilet.

## 5. Anemia  
- Hgb 8.2 on admission, chronic, multifactorial (anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency).  
- Plan: Continue iron, monitor H/H, no transfusion needed unless symptomatic.

## 6. Epilepsy (remote)  
- No seizure activity during admission. Confusion likely metabolic/delirium.  
- Plan: Continue home AED, monitor for seizures.

## 7. Hypertension  
- Off antihypertensives during shock.  
- Plan: Resume HCTZ if BP tolerates, titrate as outpatient.

## 8. Osteoarthritis, hand  
- Chronic, managed with naproxen prn.  
- Plan: Avoid NSAIDs if possible due to renal concerns.

## 9. Deconditioning  
- Marked weakness post-ICU.  
- Plan: PT/OT, early mobilization, nutrition consult.

## 10. Delirium  
- Likely multifactorial (ICU, metabolic, infection ruled out).  
- Plan: Reorientation, minimize sedatives, sleep hygiene.

## 11. Chronic Sinusitis  
- Stable, no acute symptoms.

### CHIEF COMPLAINT

Acute shortness of breath, chest pain, and presyncope.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alethea Crooks is a 21-year-old female with a history notable only for viral sinusitis who presented to the ED with sudden onset chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, and near-syncope. She denied prior cardiac history. No drug or tobacco use. She was recently recovering from a mild viral URI.

On arrival, she was tachycardic (HR 122), hypotensive (BP 84/55), and hypoxic (O2 sat 91% RA). She was diaphoretic and in distress. Initial ECG showed sinus tachycardia with diffuse ST changes. Troponin elevated at 8.1 ng/mL. Echocardiogram revealed severe global LV systolic dysfunction (EF 15%). She rapidly decompensated with worsening hypotension and evidence of cardiogenic shock, requiring vasopressors and urgent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP).

## IMAGING

- **Echocardiogram (5/20/24):** Severe global LV systolic dysfunction (EF 15%), mild RV dysfunction, moderate MR, no thrombus.
- **Chest X-ray (5/20/24):** Pulmonary edema, mild cardiomegaly.

---

## HOSPITAL COURSE (ICU)

- **Day 0:** Admitted to ICU for acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine. Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support.
- **Day 1:** Remained on Impella, pressors weaned slightly. Oliguric, rising creatinine, lactate improved. Developed mild transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia, likely shock liver.
- **Day 2:** Gradual improvement in MAP and urine output. Pressors further down-titrated. LV function remains poor. Extubated to high-flow NC.
- **Day 3:** Impella weaned and removed after TTE showed modest but improved LV function (EF 28%). Transitioned to oral HF meds (metoprolol, sacubitril-valsartan, spironolactone). Off pressors.

---

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Severe Acute Heart Failure (likely viral myocarditis)**
   - Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support, now removed.
   - Weaned from vasopressors.
   - Serial TTEs to monitor recovery.
   - Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF.
   - Monitor for arrhythmias.

### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury (likely ischemic)**
   - Monitored urine output, trending Cr/BUN.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Renal function improving as perfusion stabilizes.

### 3. **Transaminitis, Hyperbilirubinemia (shock liver)**
   - Expectant management, trending LFTs.
   - Liver enzymes down-trending as shock resolves.

### 4. **Volume Overload / Pulmonary Edema**
   - Diuresis with IV furosemide.
   - Fluid restriction.

### 5. **Electrolyte Abnormalities (hypokalemia, mild hyponatremia)**
   - Replete K+ as needed.
   - Monitor sodium closely.

### 6. **Contraception Management**
   - Hold Seasonique during acute illness; discuss risks/benefits prior to restart.

### 7. **Viral Sinusitis (recent)**
   - No signs of ongoing infection; no antibiotics.

### 8. **Nutrition / DVT Prophylaxis**
   - Started on tube feeds for 48 hrs; now on oral diet.
   - SCDs and low-dose heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

### 9. **Disposition**
   - Continue close cardiac monitoring.
   - Cardiology, nephrology, and ICU teams following.

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Mr. Bryant Murray is a 66-year-old male with a history of obesity, osteoarthritis, CVA, and recent viral upper respiratory infections who presented to the ED with acute-onset dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest tightness. On evaluation, he was found to be in cardiogenic shock (SBP 70s, tachycardic, cool extremities, altered mentation). Initial workup revealed troponin elevation, diffuse ST depressions, and echo showing severely reduced LVEF (~10%), global hypokinesis. Cardiology and CV surgery were consulted. Due to persistent shock and end-organ hypoperfusion despite maximal medical therapy (dobutamine, norepi), a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on HD#1 for hemodynamic support.

His course was complicated by AKI (Cr peak 2.4), transaminitis, and delirium. He was weaned off pressors by HD#3, and Impella was explanted on HD#5 after TTE showed improved LVEF (~25%) and hemodynamic stability. He remains on telemetry, with slow improvement in respiratory status and renal function. Neurology is following for prior CVA and delirium.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock, Severe LV Dysfunction  
- **Assessment:** Likely ischemic etiology; no prior known CAD. S/p Impella CP placement for refractory shock. LVEF improved to 25%.
- **Plan:**
    - Continue GDMT for HF (ACEi started, BB pending further stability).
    - Aspirin, clopidogrel, statin initiated.
    - Serial TTEs for LVEF.
    - Telemetry monitoring.
    - Outpatient cardiac cath planned post-stabilization.

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)  
- **Assessment:** Multifactorial—pre-renal from hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic exposure (contrast from CT angio HD#1). Cr peaked at 2.4, now trending down.
- **Plan:**
    - IVF as tolerated.
    - Avoid nephrotoxins.
    - Monitor UOP, daily BMP.
    - Renal dosing for all meds.

### 3. Delirium  
- **Assessment:** Likely multifactorial—ICU, metabolic derangement, prior CVA, infection.
- **Plan:**
    - Minimize sedatives.
    - Early mobilization.
    - Sleep hygiene.
    - Neuro checks q2h.
    - Psychiatry consult if persistent.

### 4. CVA, remote  
- **Assessment:** No new focal deficits. Continued on clopidogrel.
- **Plan:**
    - Continue DAPT.
    - Monitor for hemorrhagic conversion.
    - PT/OT to assess baseline.

### 5. Obesity, BMI 30  
- **Assessment:** BMI 31.2 on admission.
- **Plan:**
    - Nutrition consult.
    - Calorie restriction.
    - Encourage mobility as tolerated.

### 6. Osteoarthritis (Knee)  
- **Assessment:** Chronic, flares with inactivity.
- **Plan:**
    - Scheduled acetaminophen.
    - Resume PT when able.

### 7. Acute Bronchitis & Recent Viral URI  
- **Assessment:** Productive cough on admission, now improved. No new infiltrates on CXR.
- **Plan:**
    - Supportive care.
    - Incentive spirometry.

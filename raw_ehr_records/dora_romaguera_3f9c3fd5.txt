### ADMISSION SUMMARY

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, chest heaviness over 2 days.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
Dora Romaguera is a 65-year-old obese female with PMHx notable for obesity (BMI 30+), recurrent viral sinusitis, whiplash injury, and dental issues, who presented to the ED with acute onset dyspnea, chest discomfort, and profound fatigue. She was found to be hypoxic and hypotensive on arrival. Initial workup revealed elevated cardiac markers, pulmonary edema on CXR, and echocardiogram showed LVEF 15% with global hypokinesis. She rapidly deteriorated with worsening hypotension and was transferred to the MICU for management of cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressors and subsequently, temporary left-sided heart pump (Impella CP) placement.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
- Initial presentation with severe LV dysfunction (LVEF 15%), hypotension, pulmonary edema.
- Required vasopressors, inotropes, and temporary LV mechanical support (Impella CP).
- Gradual recovery, Impella weaned and removed.
- Plan:
  - Continue guideline-directed HF therapy: carvedilol, sacubitril-valsartan, spironolactone.
  - Daily weights, strict I/O, low-salt diet.
  - Cardiology f/u, consider ICD if EF remains <35% at 3 months.
  - Cardiac rehab referral.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, multifactorial)**
- Likely due to low cardiac output, improved with hemodynamics.
- Monitor Cr, BUN, lytes daily.
- Avoid nephrotoxins, maintain euvolemia.

**3. Obesity (BMI ~30)**
- Contributing to HF and OSA risk.
- Nutrition consult, calorie restriction.
- Encourage PT/OT, gradual weight loss.

**4. Recent Viral Sinusitis/Pharyngitis**
- Treated outpatient, recent amoxicillin-clavulanate.
- No current signs of bacterial infection.
- De-escalated antibiotics on negative cultures.

**5. Pain, Mild (Neck, Dental)**
- Chronic neck pain (whiplash hx), impacted molars.
- Acetaminophen PRN, avoid NSAIDs due to renal risk.
- Dental f/u after discharge.

**6. Hyperlipidemia**
- LDL suboptimal, start atorvastatin 20mg qhs.
- Lifestyle modification.

**7. Physical Deconditioning**
- Bedrest >3d, risk for debility.
- Early mobilization, PT/OT daily.

**8. DVT Prophylaxis**
- SCDs, SQ heparin.

**9. Family/Discharge Planning**
- Discussed with patient/family; needs home support.
- Anticipate DC to home with VNA.

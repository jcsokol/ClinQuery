**INPATIENT NOTE – ICU (EPIC SIMULATION)**  
**Patient Name:** Simon Rutherford  
**MRN:** 00217743  
**DOB:** 10/02/1939 (Age: 84)  
**Sex:** Male  
**Date of Admission:** 2024-05-28  
**Primary Team:** Cardiology/ICU  
**Attending:** Dr. K. Hargrove  
**Consults:** Cardiac Surgery, Infectious Disease, Endocrinology

**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest discomfort.

---

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  
Mr. Simon Rutherford is an 84-year-old male with a history of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 31%), coronary artery disease s/p PCI x2, anemia, prediabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He reported intermittent chest heaviness, mild cough, and reduced exercise tolerance. No fevers, but mild chills and sore throat 4 days ago (treated with penicillin for presumed strep throat). Home meds include simvastatin, clopidogrel, amlodipine, nitroglycerin, metoprolol, and furosemide.

In the ED, he was found to be hypoxic (O2 sat 89% RA), tachycardic (HR 112), BP 87/55 mmHg, and mildly confused. Initial labs showed elevated NT-proBNP, troponin 0.11 (mildly elevated), and evidence of acute on chronic renal insufficiency. He rapidly developed hypotension refractory to fluids, requiring norepinephrine, and was transferred to the ICU for management of cardiogenic shock. Given persistent shock and worsening end-organ perfusion, a decision was made to place a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for temporary mechanical circulatory support.

**PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

1. **Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Acute on Chronic Systolic HF**  
   - Likely precipitated by recent viral illness (sinusitis/pharyngitis) and possible demand ischemia.  
   - Required temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP) for 4 days with good response.  
   - Continue GDMT (guideline-directed medical therapy) for HFrEF, optimize diuresis, monitor for arrhythmias.  
   - Cardiology to follow; consider advanced therapies if recurrent decompensation.

2. **Chronic Congestive Heart Failure (HFrEF, LVEF 31%)**  
   - Continue beta-blocker (metoprolol), ACEi held for AKI, resume when renal function recovers.  
   - Diurese to euvolemia.  
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os.

3. **Acute Kidney Injury on CKD**  
   - Likely pre-renal from low output state, improved with LVAD support.  
   - Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxic agents, adjust medications per GFR.

4. **Anemia (Chronic, Multifactorial)**  
   - Hgb nadir 9.7 g/dL, likely anemia of chronic disease + mild dilutional effect.  
   - Monitor CBC q48h, iron studies pending.

5. **Recent Streptococcal Pharyngitis, Viral Sinusitis**  
   - Completed penicillin course.  
   - No current signs of infection, blood cultures negative.  
   - Monitor for secondary infection.

6. **Hyperlipidemia**  
   - Continue statin therapy.

7. **Prediabetes**  
   - Glucose controlled during admission.  
   - Monitor HgbA1c outpatient.

8. **Coronary Artery Disease**  
   - Continue dual antiplatelet therapy, statin.  
   - Cardiac surgery consulted for advanced heart failure options.

9. **Delirium/Altered Mental Status (resolved)**  
   - Likely multifactorial (shock, hypoxemia).  
   - Resolved as hemodynamics improved.

10. **Pain (chronic, related to remote whiplash)**  
    - Non-opioid analgesia as needed.

---

**DISPOSITION:**  
- Stable for transfer to stepdown unit.  
- Close monitoring for recurrent decompensation.  
- Multidisciplinary care: PT/OT, nutrition, case management.

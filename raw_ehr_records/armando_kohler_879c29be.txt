### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Unresponsive at home, found pulseless. Bystander CPR initiated, ROSC achieved after 12 minutes.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
39M with PMH of HTN, chronic sinusitis, prediabetes, anemia, presented after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Family reports he complained of sinus congestion and mild chest discomfort for 3 days prior. On day of event, wife found him collapsed and apneic. EMS arrived within 6 min, initial rhythm was VF. ACLS protocol followed, 2 shocks delivered, ROSC after 12 min. Intubated in field. Transported to ED.

In ED: hypotensive, tachycardic, O2 sat 98% on vent. ECG: anterior STEMI. Troponin elevated. Echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, LV dilatation. Cardiogenic shock ensued, requiring norepinephrine, dobutamine, and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement. Subsequently upgraded to Impella CP device for ongoing shock. Emergent cardiac cath: 100% LAD occlusion, PCI performed with DES placement.

Admitted to MICU for post-arrest care, targeted temperature management (TTM), and hemodynamic monitoring.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock S/P Cardiac Arrest (VF, Anterior STEMI)**
- S/P out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, initial rhythm VF, large anterior STEMI
- Underwent emergent PCI to LAD, required temporary mechanical circulatory support (IABP → Impella CP)
- Shock resolved, Impella explanted on day 4
- Plan: Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), close monitoring, cardiac rehab consult

**2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure**
- Severely reduced LVEF, likely stunned myocardium
- Diuresed for mild pulmonary edema
- Plan: Initiate low-dose carvedilol, titrate as tolerated, continue furosemide PRN, monitor volume status

**3. Post-anoxic Brain Injury**
- TTM performed, now at neurologic baseline except mild memory deficits
- Plan: Neuropsych eval, PT/OT, continue supportive care

**4. AKI, improving**
- Likely multifactorial: shock, nephrotoxins, contrast
- Renal function improving, UOP adequate
- Plan: Avoid nephrotoxins, monitor lytes, renal dosing as needed

**5. Anemia (chronic, stable)**
- Baseline Hgb ~10; likely multifactorial (anemia of chronic disease, mild CKD)
- Plan: Monitor, no transfusion needed unless Hgb <7 or symptomatic

**6. Chronic Sinusitis / Recent Viral URI**
- Treated with amox-clav on admission (now stopped)
- No evidence of active infection
- Plan: Supportive care, ENT f/u as outpatient

**7. Hypertension / Prediabetes**
- Restarted HCTZ, monitor BP
- Dietician consult for prediabetes

**8. DVT Prophylaxis**
- On heparin SQ, SCDs

**9. Secondary Prevention**
- Started on aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, carvedilol, lisinopril (titrated as tolerated)
- Counseling on lifestyle, risk factor modification

---

## DISPOSITION
- MICU → stepdown, anticipated transfer to cardiac rehab/telemetry in 2 days if stable

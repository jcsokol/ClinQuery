# History of Present Illness

35-year-old male with a history of hypertension, prediabetes, chronic anemia, and remote viral sinusitis, who presented to the ED after 4 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema, with associated fatigue and mild confusion. He reported a recent URI 2 weeks ago, now resolved. On the morning of admission, he experienced near-syncope and was found to be hypotensive at home. On arrival, BP 82/51, HR 124, RR 24, O2 92% RA. Initial labs revealed acute renal insufficiency and troponin elevation. Echo in ED demonstrated new severe global LV dysfunction (EF 15%), RV mildly reduced, no significant valvulopathy. He was admitted to the MICU for cardiogenic shock.  

Despite initial management with dobutamine and norepinephrine, patient remained hypotensive, oliguric, and acidotic. He was intubated for worsening hypoxemia and altered mental status. After multidisciplinary discussion, a percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) was placed for temporary mechanical circulatory support on hospital day 1.  

Hospital course has been complicated by anemia requiring transfusion, ongoing renal dysfunction, and persistent hypotension. He developed a right thigh hematoma at the Impella insertion site with mild overlying ecchymosis.

# Problem-Based Assessment and Plan

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Acute Severe LV Dysfunction
- Likely viral myocarditis vs. idiopathic
- Required intubation, vasoactive support, and Impella CP
- Now off Impella, stable; continue cardiac monitoring, daily EKGs, telemetry
- TTE to reassess LV function in 24h
- Start guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF as tolerated (ACEi/ARB, BB, spironolactone)
- Cardiology f/u, consider endomyocardial biopsy if no improvement

## 2. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO Stage 3), on CRRT
- Likely multifactorial: low perfusion, hypotension, nephrotoxic exposure
- CRRT ongoing, monitor lytes and volume status q6h
- Renal dosing of all meds
- Nephrology following
- Strict I/Os, daily weights

## 3. Anemia (multifactorial: baseline, dilutional, hemolysis, blood loss)
- Baseline chronic anemia, worsened by Impella-induced hemolysis and blood loss (thigh hematoma)
- Monitor CBC q12h, transfuse for Hgb <7.5 or symptomatic anemia
- Iron studies, haptoglobin, LDH sent
- Hematology consult if persistent decline

## 4. Right Thigh Hematoma at Impella Insertion Site
- Monitored with serial exams, no expansion, no neurovascular compromise
- No active bleeding, Hgb stabilized
- Ice packs, limb elevation, no anticoagulation unless indicated
- Vascular surgery on standby

## 5. Volume Overload/CHF
- On furosemide drip, now euvolemic
- Daily CXR, monitor for pulmonary edema
- Gradually liberalize fluids as renal function recovers

## 6. Delirium/ICU Psychosis
- Mild, improving after extubation
- Nonpharmacologic measures: re-orientation, sleep-wake cycle, minimize restraints
- Quetiapine PRN for agitation

## 7. Prediabetes
- Monitor BG q6h, sliding scale insulin as needed
- Endocrine to see if persistent hyperglycemia

## 8. Hypertension
- Off home HCTZ for now due to AKI
- Restart as tolerated after renal recovery

## 9. Pain (mild, thigh)
- Acetaminophen PRN
- No opioids due to delirium

## 10. Infection Prophylaxis
- VAP, CLABSI, CAUTI bundles in place
- Daily oral care, chlorhexidine baths

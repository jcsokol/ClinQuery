Epic EHR - Progress Note

PATIENT NAME: Sam Bechtelar
MRN: 00394125
DOB: 09/02/1999  (Age: 24 years)
SEX: Male
DATE OF SERVICE: 06/15/2024
ATTENDING: Dr. L. Riggins
ADMITTING SERVICE: Cardiac ICU

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath and chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
24-year-old male with h/o hypertension, acute bronchitis, and viral sinusitis, who presented to the ED with acute onset SOB, orthopnea, and pleuritic chest pain. Patient reported a 3-day history of worsening cough, low-grade fevers, myalgias, and progressive dyspnea. On arrival, was found to be tachycardic (HR 124), hypotensive (BP 86/54), tachypneic (RR 28), and hypoxic (SpO2 88% RA). Rapid deterioration with altered mental status and evidence of poor perfusion. Bedside echo revealed severely reduced LVEF (~15%) with global hypokinesis. Given rapid progression to cardiogenic shock, patient was transferred to the CICU and a temporary left-sided heart pump (Impella CP) was emergently placed for circulatory support.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Hypertension
- Acute bronchitis (recent)
- Viral sinusitis (recent)
- No known CAD, DM, CKD

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
- None

SOCIAL HISTORY:
- Non-smoker
- No alcohol or illicit drug use
- Lives with parents, works as a barista

FAMILY HISTORY:
- Father with hypertension
- Mother with hypothyroidism

ALLERGIES:
- NKDA

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
- Acetaminophen/Dextromethorphan/Doxylamine syrup (prn)
- Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PHYSICAL EXAM (ICU Day 1):
Gen: Appears acutely ill, intubated, sedated.
HEENT: PERRL, no icterus, oropharynx clear.
CV: Tachycardic, Impella in situ, soft S1/S2, no murmurs.
Lungs: Crackles b/l bases, decreased air entry, on mechanical ventilation.
Abd: Soft, non-tender, normal bowel sounds.
Ext: Cool, mottled peripheries, 1+ pitting edema bilat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

IMAGING:
- CXR (6/13/24): Pulmonary edema, bilateral patchy opacities, small bilateral pleural effusions.
- Echo (6/13/24): LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, LV dilated, RV normal, no significant valvular disease.
- Repeat Echo (6/15/24): LVEF improved to 38% with Impella support.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ICU COURSE (Days 1-3):
- Day 1: Cardiogenic shock, required norepinephrine, Impella CP placed, intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
- Day 2: Pressors weaned as perfusion improved. Extubated to high-flow nasal cannula. Impella flows stable.
- Day 3: Impella wean trial successful. LVEF improved. Transitioned to oral antihypertensives. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

1. **Cardiogenic shock, likely viral myocarditis**
   - Emergent Impella CP placement for hemodynamic support
   - Norepinephrine, weaned off by Day 2
   - Serial cardiac markers, echo for recovery monitoring
   - Infectious workup (viral PCR, blood cultures) pending
   - Plan: Continue Impella wean, monitor for arrhythmias, start guideline-directed medical therapy for HF as tolerated

2. **Acute hypoxic respiratory failure**
   - Intubated, mechanical ventilation x 36 hrs
   - Extubated to HFNC on Day 2
   - Daily CXR, pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry post-extubation

3. **Hypertension**
   - Home HCTZ held initially, restarted on Day 3
   - IV antihypertensives transitioned to oral as tolerated

4. **Volume overload / AKI**
   - Initial worsening of renal function (Cr 2.2), improved with restoration of perfusion (Cr 1.0 by Day 3)
   - Daily weights, I/Os, adjust diuresis as tolerated

5. **Transaminitis**
   - Likely shock liver, improving with perfusion restoration
   - Serial LFTs, trending down

6. **Acute bronchitis/viral sinusitis**
   - Supportive care, no evidence of bacterial superinfection
   - No antibiotics started

7. **Pain/anxiety**
   - Analgesia with fentanyl/propofol while intubated, transitioned to acetaminophen PO post-extubation

8. **DVT prophylaxis**
   - SCDs, enoxaparin started once bleeding risk low

9. **Nutrition**
   - NPO initially, NG tube feeds started Day 2, transitioned to oral on Day 3

10. **Disposition**
   - Anticipate transfer to step-down unit once Impella removed and stable off pressors

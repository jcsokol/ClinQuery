**EPIC EHR – Inpatient Progress Note**  
**Patient:** Harry Emmerich  
**MRN:** 0081193  
**DOB:** 08/19/1938 (85 y/o)  
**Sex:** Male  
**Date of Admission:** 04/11/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. S. McCarthy  
**Location:** MICU, Bed 4B

### CHIEF COMPLAINT  
Worsening shortness of breath and lower extremity edema x 1 week.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  
Mr. Harry Emmerich is an 85-year-old male with a history of obesity, prediabetes, chronic sinusitis, anemia, and prior stroke who presented to the ED with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and increasing bilateral leg swelling over 7 days. He denied chest pain but did endorse mild cough and fatigue. He was recently treated for viral sinusitis with amoxicillin/clavulanate.

On arrival to the ED, he was found to be tachypneic, hypoxic, and hypotensive. Initial labs revealed acute on chronic anemia, elevated BNP, and a rising creatinine. CXR demonstrated pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions. ECG showed new LBBB. Echo showed severely reduced LVEF (15%) with global hypokinesis and LV dilation.

Due to progressive cardiogenic shock (hypotension refractory to fluids, escalating vasopressor requirements, worsening renal function, rising lactate), he was emergently transferred to the MICU and a left-sided percutaneous ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed for circulatory support.

## ICU HOSPITAL COURSE (abridged)  
**Day 1:**  
- Admitted to MICU for cardiogenic shock, placed on norepinephrine and dobutamine  
- Impella CP placed via left femoral artery

- Echo: LVEF 15%, Impella flow 3.2 L/min  
- Started on low-dose metoprolol  

**Day 3:**  
- Mild hemolysis (LDH up, haptoglobin low), platelets dropped to 90  
- Required 2U PRBC for Hgb 7.2  
- Weaning Impella support, trial off dobutamine  
- Ongoing diuresis, improved oxygenation  

**Day 4:**

# **ASSESSMENT & PLAN**  

**1. Cardiogenic shock, new HFrEF (EF 15%), s/p Impella CP**  
- Likely secondary to acute decompensation on background of undiagnosed ischemic cardiomyopathy  
- Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support, now removed after 72 hrs  
- On milrinone, weaning off pressors  
- Daily echo monitoring, continue aggressive diuresis  
- Start guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF as tolerated  
- Cardiology, CT surgery, and advanced HF teams following  

**2. Acute kidney injury (pre-renal, cardiorenal)**  
- Likely secondary to low cardiac output state  
- UOP improving, Cr trending down  
- Monitor lytes, strict I/Os, avoid nephrotoxins  

**3. Anemia, multifactorial (chronic + device-related hemolysis)**  
- Transfused 2U PRBCs for Hgb <8  
- Monitor Hgb, retic, LDH, haptoglobin  
- Hold anti-plt/anticoagulation while platelets <100  

**4. Thrombocytopenia (device-related, dilutional)**  
- Platelets nadir 90, trending up after device removal  
- Monitor for bleeding, no transfusion at this time  

**5. Obesity, prediabetes**

- Monitor glucose, A1c 6.2%  
- Nutrition consult for calorie/protein goals  

**6. Chronic sinusitis, recent viral exacerbation**  
- Completed course of amox/clav

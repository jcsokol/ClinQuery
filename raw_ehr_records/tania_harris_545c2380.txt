# ICU Course Summary

**Day 1-2:**  
Admitted in cardiogenic shock, rapidly deteriorated, intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Started on dobutamine, norepi, furosemide IV. Cardiac index 1.6, wedge 28. Urgent placement of Impella CP for mechanical support. Started anticoagulation (heparin drip). Infectious w/u: negative blood/urine cultures, procalcitonin low. Cardiac MRI: suggestive of viral myocarditis.

**Day 3-4:**  
Hemodynamics improved with Impella, weaned off vasopressors. Remains volume overloaded; aggressive diuresis continued. LFTs uptrending, likely congestive hepatopathy. Cardiac enzymes trended down. Extubated on day 4.

**Day 5-7:**  
Continued improvement, Impella weaned and explanted on day 6. Echo: LVEF improved to 35%. Renal function stable, mild transaminitis persists. Mobilization with PT/OT. Psych and nutrition consults for obesity and post-ICU depression.

**Day 8:**  
Transferred to step-down. Discussed long-term HF therapy, outpatient follow-up.

# Problem List & Assessment/Plan

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock, likely viral myocarditis  
- Initial presentation: acute decompensated HF, likely secondary to viral myocarditis.  
- Managed with pressors and mechanical support (Impella CP)  
- Monitoring for arrhythmias (telemetry)  
- Cardiac enzymes trending down; LVEF improving  
- Plan: Continue GDMT, close monitoring, consider cardiac MRI outpatient

## 2. Acute decompensated heart failure  
- Diuresis with IV furosemide  
- Fluid status monitored daily  
- Transitioning to oral regimen as tolerated  
- Plan: Outpatient HF clinic, education, sodium restriction

## 3. Obesity (BMI 31)  
- Nutrition consult, PT/OT involvement  
- Calorie-controlled diet, consider weight loss program on discharge  
- Plan: Outpatient dietitian f/u

## 4. Hypertension  
- Off home antihypertensives during shock  
- Restarted on low-dose ACEi and BB as tolerated  
- Plan: Titrate to goal BP, monitor for hypotension

## 5. Transaminitis, likely congestive hepatopathy  
- LFTs peaked on day 3, improving with volume removal  
- No evidence of viral hepatitis  
- Plan: Trend LFTs, continue diuresis, supportive care

## 6. Anxiety/depression, post-ICU  
- Psych consult  
- Initiated supportive counseling  
- Plan: Outpatient psych follow-up

## 7. Contraceptive management  
- Holding estrogen-containing OCPs given VTE risk in setting of shock/immobility  
- Plan: Discuss alternatives at discharge

# Discharge Planning / Education

- Home with parents, arrange home health for first week  
- Strict sodium/fluid restriction, daily weights  
- Close f/u with cardiology, HF clinic, nutrition  
- Outpatient echo in 2 weeks  
- Return precautions: SOB, CP, LE swelling, syncope

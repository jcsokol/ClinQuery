# HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

27-year-old obese female with a history of hypertension, recurrent sinusitis, and recent acute bronchitis, admitted with acute onset dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest pressure. She was 3 weeks postpartum after an uncomplicated term pregnancy. She presented to the ED with rapidly worsening respiratory distress, requiring noninvasive ventilation. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Troponin mildly elevated; BNP 2350. Echo revealed LVEF 10%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR. She was admitted to the ICU for management of acute decompensated heart failure (likely peripartum cardiomyopathy). Despite diuresis and inotropes, she developed cardiogenic shock and required temporary mechanical circulatory support with a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP).

# HOSPITAL COURSE

- **Day 1:** Admitted to ICU, started on BiPAP, IV furosemide, dobutamine. Invasive monitoring (A-line, CVC) placed.  
- **Day 2:** Worsening hypotension and hypoxia. Lactate 4.2. Bedside echo: no improvement. Impella CP inserted via femoral approach.  
- **Day 3:** Improved perfusion. Weaned off vasopressors.  
- **Day 4-5:** Gradual diuresis, renal function stabilized.  
- **Day 6:** Respiratory status improved, transitioned to nasal cannula.  
- **Day 7:** Impella weaned and explanted at bedside.  
- **Day 8:** Transferred to step-down for ongoing HF management.

# ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**27F with PMHx of HTN, obesity, remote sinusitis/bronchitis, 3 weeks postpartum, presenting with new-onset severe heart failure and shock, requiring temporary LVAD.**

---

## 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Likely Peripartum Cardiomyopathy**
- Admitted with acute HF, rapidly deteriorated to shock (cold, hypotensive, high lactate, low UOP)
- Required Impella CP for 5 days, now explanted
- Plan:
    - Continue aggressive diuresis, daily weights, strict I&Os
    - GDMT for HF: initiate low-dose carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone
    - Serial echo to monitor recovery
    - Cardiology f/u, consider wearable defibrillator
    - Restrict fluids/sodium

## 2. **Hypertension**
- Controlled pre-admission, now low BP post-shock
- Hold HCTZ for now, titrate antihypertensives as tolerated

## 3. **Obesity (BMI 30.1)**
- Nutrition consult for weight loss counseling
- Daily calorie/protein targets

## 4. **Recent Pregnancy**
- 3 weeks postpartum, no complications
- OB consulted, no active issues

## 5. **Acute Bacterial Sinusitis/Bronchitis (recent)**
- Completed antibiotics
- No current evidence of infection
- Monitor WBC, temp

## 6. **Anemia/Thrombocytopenia (mild, transient during shock)**
- Monitoring CBC daily
- No transfusion needed

## 7. **Renal Dysfunction (AKI on CKD?)**
- Creatinine peaked at 2.1, now improved
- Monitor renal function, adjust meds

## 8. **Social/Disposition**
- Social work: arrange home health, support for 4 children
- Psych: screen for postpartum depression

### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Acute onset chest pain and dyspnea.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
29F with past medical history significant for chronic pain, migraine, recurrent pregnancy loss, and a prior drug overdose, presented to the ED with acute substernal chest pain radiating to the back, associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and near-syncope. No recent trauma. No fever. She denied ongoing illicit drug use, but has a remote history of benzodiazepine overdose. She is on multiple forms of contraception (Errin, Yaz, Trinessa, medroxyprogesterone), and has struggled with chronic migraines and body pain.

She was found to be hypotensive in the ED (BP 78/50 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 128), and hypoxic (SpO2 86% RA). Initial ECG showed ST elevations in V2-V4. Troponin I was 8.2 ng/mL. Emergent echo demonstrated severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, and moderate mitral regurgitation. She rapidly developed cardiogenic shock requiring norepinephrine, dobutamine, and then emergent temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) placement in the cath lab.

### HOSPITAL COURSE
- **Day 1:** Admitted to CICU, Impella CP placed, started on milrinone, norepinephrine. Intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.  
- **Day 2:** Labs showed improving lactate, persistent AKI. LVEF remains low. Weaned norepinephrine.  
- **Day 3:** Some improvement in urine output. Still requiring Impella for hemodynamic support. Developed mild transaminitis.  
- **Day 4:** Extubated. Impella weaning trial started.  
- **Day 5:** Successfully weaned off Impella, device explanted. LVEF improved to 30%.  
- **Day 6:** Stepped down to telemetry. Stable.

### PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to acute severe heart failure (presumed myocarditis vs MI)**
  - Impella CP placed for temporary LV support, now explanted.
  - Guideline-directed medical therapy for HF initiated.
  - Serial echocardiograms for recovery.
  - Monitor for arrhythmias, volume status.
  - Plan: Continue beta-blocker, ACEi as tolerated, diuresis as needed.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), likely multifactorial (hypoperfusion, diuretics)**
  - Monitored urine output and daily Chem7.
  - Renal function improving post-reperfusion.
  - Avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal dosing.

**3. Transaminitis**
  - Mild, likely ischemic hepatitis from shock.
  - Trending down, continue to monitor LFTs.

**4. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure**
  - Required intubation, now extubated.
  - Pulmonary edema improved with diuresis.
  - Monitor for reaccumulation.

**5. Chronic Pain, Migraine**
  - Continue home regimen.
  - Avoid NSAIDs due to renal/hepatic dysfunction.
  - PRN acetaminophen.

**6. Contraception/OB hx**
  - On multiple hormonal contraceptives.
  - Discuss with OB/GYN at discharge re: VTE risk.

**7. Psychosocial, History of Overdose**
  - Psychiatry consult, no acute SI/HI.
  - Social work for support, safe discharge planning.

**8. Dental (impacted molars)**
  - Non-urgent, outpatient dental follow-up.

---

### DISPOSITION
- Step-down to telemetry, then home with close cardiology follow-up.
- Strict return precautions for chest pain, dyspnea, syncope.
- Outpatient echo in 2 weeks, labs in 1 week.
- Continue GDMT for HF.

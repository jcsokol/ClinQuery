### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Ms. Susana Trejo is a 84-year-old female with a past medical history of ischemic stroke, obesity, chronic intractable migraines, colon cancer status post partial colectomy, chronic pain, and recent drug overdose, who presented to the ED with acute-onset chest pain and dyspnea. She rapidly developed hypotension and signs of cardiogenic shock. Her course was complicated by acute decompensated heart failure and she required placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support on hospital day 2. She was transferred to the ICU for ongoing management.

---

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (s/p Impella, Day 10):**  
- Likely secondary to acute myocardial infarction (troponin peaked at 7.3 ng/mL on HD1, new anterior wall hypokinesis on TTE).  
- Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine for inotropic support; weaned after Impella placement.  
- Serial echocardiograms: improvement in EF from 25% to 38%.  
- Plan: Continue Impella wean, monitor hemodynamics, transition to oral HF regimen (carvedilol, spironolactone). Cardiology to reevaluate for device removal.

**2. Ischemic Stroke (remote, with mild left hemiparesis):**  
- No acute findings on CT/MRI this admission.  
- Neurology consulted.  
- PT/OT involved for mobility, fall risk precautions in place.

**3. Colon Cancer (s/p partial colectomy, hx polyps):**  
- Oncology following. No evidence of acute GI bleeding, but guaiac positive stool x1.  
- Recent CEA pending; colonoscopy 3 months ago showed no recurrence.  
- Plan: Monitor H/H, continue DVT prophylaxis, resume home aspirin when safe.

**4. Obesity (BMI 30+):**  
- Dietician consulted.  
- Calorie-restricted diabetic diet.  
- Encourage mobility as tolerated.

**5. Chronic Intractable Migraines:**  
- Home ibuprofen continued as needed.  
- Avoided triptans due to stroke/CAD history.  
- Pain management to readdress regimen at discharge.

**6. Chronic Pain (multifactorial, hx impacted molars, ankle sprain):**  
- On scheduled acetaminophen, PRN oxycodone for severe pain (rare).  
- Dental consult for impacted molars deferred until stable.

**7. Drug Overdose (hx, not related to this admission):**  
- No recurrence during hospitalization.  
- Psychiatry to assess prior to discharge.

**8. Acute Streptococcal Pharyngitis & Viral Sinusitis (recent):**  
- Completed course of Penicillin V pre-admission.  
- No current infection signs.

**9. Other Active Issues:**  
- Electrolyte disturbances during ICU stay (see labs).  
- Mild transaminitis, likely ischemic hepatitis vs. medication effect.  
- Foley catheter removed HD5, now voiding independently.

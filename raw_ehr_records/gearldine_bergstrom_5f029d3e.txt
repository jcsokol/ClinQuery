-------------------------------------------------------------
Patient Name: Gearldine Bergstrom
MRN: 00241758
DOB: 09/13/1962 (61 yo)
Sex: Female
Date of Admission: 04/02/2024
Attending: Dr. Janet Yoon, MD
Admitting Dx: Cardiogenic Shock, Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
Location: MICU, Bed 17
-------------------------------------------------------------
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Ms. Gearldine Bergstrom is a 61-year-old female with a history notable for obesity, T2DM, metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, and chronic sinusitis, presenting with 2 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. She reported paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and had a syncopal episode at home. EMS found her hypotensive (BP 78/52), tachycardic (HR 112), and hypoxic (O2 sat 87% RA). She required noninvasive ventilation in the ED and developed profound hypotension unresponsive to fluids and pressors. Cardiology was consulted and she was emergently transferred to the MICU for acute decompensated heart failure with likely cardiogenic shock. Given continued instability, a decision was made to place a percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

ICU HOSPITAL COURSE (Days 1-7)
Day 1: Admission to MICU for acute decompensated HF, cardiogenic shock. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine, high-flow O2. Emergent placement of Impella CP LVAD for refractory shock. Echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, RV preserved, moderate MR, no tamponade. Started on heparin drip for device. Foley placed. Central and arterial lines placed.
Day 2: Improved MAPs, weaned norepinephrine. Still oliguric, mild AKI. Glucose trending up, started insulin sliding scale. CXR: mild pulmonary edema, no consolidation. 
Day 3: Remains on Impella, improving end-organ perfusion. Lactate normalizing. Developed fever, blood cx sent. Vanc/cefepime started empirically.
Day 4: Afebrile, negative blood cx. Renal function stable, weaned off pressors. Echo: LVEF 20%. Started low-dose carvedilol, continued diuresis with IV furosemide.
Day 5: Impella weaned, device removed without complication. Mobilized to chair. Mild delirium overnight, improved with reorientation.
Day 6: Transitioned to nasal cannula. Stable hemodynamics. Continued diuresis, glucose well-controlled.
Day 7: Transferred to stepdown unit. Plan for cardiac rehab, GDMT titration, outpatient follow-up.

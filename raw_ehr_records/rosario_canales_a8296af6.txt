### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

21-year-old female with PMHx notable for viral sinusitis (multiple prior episodes), recent upper respiratory tract infection, and no known cardiac disease, who presented to the ED with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest tightness. Initially seen by PCP for presumed viral sinusitis, but developed acute hypoxemia and was brought in by EMS after syncopal episode at home. On arrival: tachycardic (HR 128), hypotensive (BP 84/54), O2 sat 88% RA, febrile (38.6°C). Exam notable for diffuse rales, JVD, cool extremities, S3 gallop. CXR: pulmonary vascular congestion, enlarged cardiac silhouette. Rapidly decompensated, requiring intubation and vasopressors. Echo: severe global LV dysfunction (EF ~10%), mild RV dysfunction, no significant valvular disease. Transferred to ICU, started on inotropes; over next 12 hours remained in cardiogenic shock refractory to medical therapy. Cardiology consulted, urgent placement of left-sided Impella CP device for mechanical circulatory support.

#### Labs missing for ICU Day 6 (pt transferred out of ICU to telemetry floor).

## HOSPITAL COURSE (ICU Days 1-6)

- **ICU Day 1:** Admitted in cardiogenic shock, intubated, started on norepinephrine, dobutamine. Impella CP placed via femoral artery. Started on heparin drip for device. Initial labs with mild AKI (Cr 1.6), transaminitis, lactic acidosis. Infectious w/u negative (blood, urine, sputum cx). IV antibiotics continued for pneumonia coverage.
- **ICU Day 2:** Remains intubated. Impella flows 3.1 L/min. Vasopressors weaned. Renal function worsened (Cr 1.8), LFTs peaked. Echo: persistent severe LV dysfunction. Troponin trended down. Mild drop in platelets.
- **ICU Day 3:** Extubated to HFNC. Mental status improved. Impella support ongoing. Inotropes off. Renal, hepatic function improving. Platelets nadir 131, no bleeding.
- **ICU Day 4:** Impella weaned, removed at bedside w/o complication. Echo: EF up to 28%. Diuresed w/ IV furosemide. O2 weaned to NC.
- **ICU Day 5:** Stable on floor. Renal, hepatic indices normalized. Off O2. Ambulating w/ PT. Appetite improved.
- **ICU Day 6:** Transferred to telemetry. No recurrent arrhythmias. Planning for discharge.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (presumed viral myocarditis)**  
- Initial presentation with refractory shock requiring temporary LV support (Impella CP).  
- Weaned off device successfully.  
- Serial echo: improvement in EF from 10% → 28%.  
- Plan: Continue guideline-directed HF therapy (GDMT), close monitoring, avoid strenuous activity. Outpatient follow-up with HF/Cardiology.  

**2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**  
- Intubated for respiratory distress, now successfully extubated.  
- CXR improved, O2 sat >97% on room air.  
- Continue incentive spirometry, monitor for secondary infection.

**3. Acute Kidney Injury**  
- Likely multifactorial (low perfusion, nephrotoxic meds).  
- Cr peaked at 1.8, now normalized.  
- Avoid nephrotoxins, monitor urine output, daily labs.

**4. Transaminitis/Acute Liver Injury**  
- Likely shock liver, resolved as hemodynamics improved.  
- LFTs trending down. No evidence of chronic liver disease.

**5. Thrombocytopenia**  
- Platelets dropped post-Impella, now recovering.  
- Monitored for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), negative PF4.

**6. Sinusitis**  
- Initial diagnosis, likely viral. No evidence of bacterial complications.  
- Completed course of amoxicillin-clavulanate; no further intervention.

**7. Contraceptive Management**  
- On multiple OCPs historically; review with gynecology prior to discharge.  
- Counsel on VTE risk in context of recent critical illness.

**8. Nutrition**  
- Mildly underweight (BMI 18).  
- Dietician consult. Encourage oral intake, high-calorie diet.

**9. Physical Therapy**  
- Deconditioned after ICU stay.  
- PT/OT to evaluate, mobilize, plan for safe discharge.

**10. VTE Prophylaxis**  
- SCDs, subQ heparin unless contraindicated post-Impella.

**11. Disposition**  
- Telemetry, then discharge home with close f/u.  
- Education on HF symptoms, activity restrictions, med adherence.

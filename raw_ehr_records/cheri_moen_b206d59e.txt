**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive dyspnea, chest pain, and orthopnea.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Ms. Cheri Moen is a 65-year-old female with a history notable for hypertension, type 2 diabetes (transitioned from prediabetes), hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic syndrome, and diabetic retinopathy who presented to the ED with 4 days of worsening shortness of breath, chest heaviness, and lower extremity edema. She also reported a recent viral upper respiratory infection with sore throat and sinus congestion 2 weeks prior to admission. She denied current fever but noted increased fatigue and mild confusion. On arrival, she was tachypneic, hypoxic, and hypotensive. Initial workup revealed evidence of cardiogenic shock. She was admitted directly to the cardiac ICU for further management.

On hospital day 2, following persistent hypotension despite vasopressors, she underwent urgent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic stabilization. She remained in the ICU for 9 days, during which she required diuresis, glycemic control, and management of multiple complications.

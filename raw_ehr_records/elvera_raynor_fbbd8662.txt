**Inpatient Progress Note**  
**Patient:** Elvera Raynor  
**MRN:** 0192837465  
**DOB:** 10/24/1976 (47 y/o)  
**Sex:** Female  
**Date of Admission:** 06/14/2024  
**Date of Service:** 06/20/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. L. Karp  
**Service:** Cardiology ICU

---

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest discomfort.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
47-year-old female with PMHx of hypertension, chronic sinusitis, fibromyalgia, and recent viral pharyngitis, who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening shortness of breath, chest heaviness, and lower extremity edema. She reports orthopnea and PND, and noted a 5-lb weight gain over the past week. No syncope. No recent URI symptoms. No prior cardiac history. She has a history of concussion (no LOC) and normal pregnancy in her 20s. Home meds include HCTZ, loratadine, naproxen, duloxetine, hydrocortisone cream, and an epinephrine autoinjector.

On arrival to ED, she was tachycardic (HR 112), hypertensive (BP 164/98), and hypoxic (SpO2 89% RA). CXR showed pulmonary edema. Troponin mildly elevated. BNP elevated. Echo showed severe global LV dysfunction (EF 18%), moderate MR, and no pericardial effusion. She was admitted to the CICU for acute decompensated heart failure, likely new-onset non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (possible viral or stress-induced).  

On hospital day 2, she developed worsening hypotension and hypoperfusion (cold, clammy, MAP <60 despite escalating pressors). Cardiac index <1.8 by Swan-Ganz. Emergent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was performed for refractory cardiogenic shock. She stabilized on support.

**Hospital Course Summary:**  
- **Day 1:** Admitted with acute decompensated heart failure, started on IV furosemide and nitroglycerin.  
- **Day 2:** Developed cardiogenic shock, required norepinephrine and dobutamine. Impella CP placed.  
- **Day 3–4:** Gradual improvement in end-organ perfusion. Weaned off pressors.  
- **Day 5:** Impella weaned and removed after repeat echo showed EF improved to 28%.  
- **Day 6:** Transitioned to oral heart failure regimen (carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone).  
- **Day 7:** Ambulating in ICU, euvolemic, stable hemodynamics.

# Problem List & Assessment/Plan

## 1. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure w/ Cardiogenic Shock
**Assessment:**  
New diagnosis of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (likely viral or stress-induced) with acute decompensation and cardiogenic shock requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP).  
**Plan:**  
- Continue close cardiac monitoring (telemetry, Swan-Ganz).
- Titrate heart failure regimen (goal: maximize GDMT).
- Monitor for arrhythmias, volume status.
- Cardiac rehab consult.
- Repeat TTE prior to discharge.
- Education on low-sodium diet, daily weights.

## 2. Hypertension  
**Assessment:**  
History of suboptimally controlled hypertension, likely contributed to cardiac remodeling.  
**Plan:**  
- Continue carvedilol, add sacubitril/valsartan.
- Monitor BP q4h.
- Discontinue HCTZ (risk of hypovolemia).

## 3. Chronic Sinusitis / Viral Pharyngitis (remote)  
**Assessment:**  
Remote, not active.  
**Plan:**  
- Continue supportive care as needed (loratadine PRN).
- Monitor for secondary bacterial infection.

## 4. Fibromyalgia  
**Assessment:**  
Chronic, baseline pain; currently well controlled on duloxetine.  
**Plan:**  
- Continue duloxetine.
- Assess pain daily.
- Avoid NSAIDs due to HF.

## 5. Acute Kidney Injury (on CKD?)  
**Assessment:**  
Transient rise in creatinine during shock, now improving with diuresis and improved CO.  
**Plan:**  
- Monitor daily BMP.
- Avoid nephrotoxic agents.
- Adjust diuretic dosing to renal function.

## 6. Medication Reconciliation  
**Assessment:**  
Complex regimen, several home meds not appropriate for new HF diagnosis.  
**Plan:**  
- Discontinue naproxen, HCTZ.
- Continue duloxetine, loratadine, hydrocortisone cream, EpiPen.
- Add carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone, furosemide.

## 7. DVT Prophylaxis  
**Assessment:**  
High risk due to ICU stay and Impella device.  
**Plan:**  
- SCDs while in bed.
- SQ heparin unless contraindicated.

## 8. Psychosocial/Disposition  
**Assessment:**  
Lives alone, moderate support.  
**Plan:**  
- Social work consult for discharge planning.
- Consider cardiac rehab referral.

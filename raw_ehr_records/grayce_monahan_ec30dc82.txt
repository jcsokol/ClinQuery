## HOSPITAL COURSE

Grayce Monahan is a 23-year-old female with a history of chronic pain, opioid use (on multiple narcotics), migraines, and recent rib fracture who presented to the ED after being found unresponsive at home. EMS administered naloxone with minimal response; on arrival, she was obtunded, hypotensive (BP 70/40), and hypoxic (SpO2 82% on NRB). Initial ABG revealed severe acidosis. She was intubated for airway protection.

**Shortly after arrival, she developed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.** ROSC achieved after 3 minutes of ACLS. ECG: diffuse ST depression. Bedside echo: severely reduced LVEF (~15%), dilated LV, no tamponade. Troponin I 6.2 ng/mL. Lactate 8.9. Shock index >1.2. Started on norepinephrine, vasopressin, dobutamine. Cardiology emergently consulted.

Given persistent hemodynamic instability and rising lactate, Impella CP placed at bedside via left femoral approach for temporary circulatory support. Transferred to ICU. Required mechanical ventilation and continuous sedation. Over 48 hours, gradual improvement in end-organ perfusion/lactate and weaned off pressors by hospital day 5. Impella removed on HD#6 after echo demonstrated LVEF improved to 35%. Extubated on HD#7. Psychiatry consulted for evaluation and substance use treatment recommendations.

## CONSULTS

- **Cardiology:** For management of cardiogenic shock, Impella placement, and guidance on weaning support.
- **Psychiatry:** Substance use disorder assessment, post-overdose counseling.
- **Pain Management:** Recommendations for opioid tapering and chronic pain alternatives.
- **PT/OT:** Initiated after extubation for deconditioning.

---

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic shock secondary to acute drug overdose (likely opioid/acetaminophen):**  
- Required Impella CP for temporary LV support; now off support, LVEF improving.
- Continue aggressive cardiac monitoring.
- Serial EKGs, telemetry.
- Cardiology following.

**2. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, post-arrest:**  
- Intubated, now extubated, improving clinically.
- Monitor for aspiration pneumonia.
- Chest physiotherapy, incentive spirometry.

**3. Acute kidney injury (resolved):**  
- Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, possible rhabdo.
- Creatinine improved to baseline.
- Monitor UOP, renal function.

**4. Liver injury (transaminitis, resolved):**  
- Suspected ischemic hepatitis from shock state, acetaminophen toxicity possible.
- LFTs trending down.

**5. Drug overdose (opioid/acetaminophen):**  
- Psychiatry consult.
- Social work for post-discharge planning.
- Consider transition to buprenorphine for chronic pain/SUD.

**6. Chronic pain (rib fracture, migraines):**  
- Pain team involved.
- Taper opioids; consider gabapentin, non-pharm methods.
- Headache prophylaxis: consider topiramate or propranolol.

**7. Deconditioning:**  
- PT/OT to evaluate.
- Early mobility protocol.

**8. Contraceptive management:**  
- Continue Mirena IUD, etonogestrel implant, Seasonique as per prior regimen.
- Counseling provided.

**9. Secondary issues:**  
- VTE prophylaxis with heparin.
- Stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- Monitor for arrhythmia, infection.

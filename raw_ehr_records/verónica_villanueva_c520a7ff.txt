### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Verónica Villanueva is a 96-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer’s dementia, prediabetes, chronic anemia, hyperlipidemia, and remote miscarriage, who presented to the ED from her nursing facility for acute-onset confusion, productive cough, and dyspnea. She was hypoxic and hypotensive on arrival (BP 78/54, SpO2 84% RA), requiring oxygen escalation and fluid resuscitation. Chest X-ray showed right lower lobe consolidation, and blood cultures were obtained.

Over the next 12 hours, she developed progressive hypotension and signs of shock refractory to fluids and vasopressors. Echocardiogram revealed severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF 15%), global hypokinesis, and elevated filling pressures. Cardiology was consulted and recommended placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction with underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy.

She was transferred to the MICU, where the Impella was placed uneventfully via femoral approach. She remains on mechanical circulatory support with Impella, low-dose norepinephrine, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

1. **Cardiogenic Shock (presumed sepsis-induced + ischemic cardiomyopathy)**
   - Impella CP placed (2/1) for hemodynamic support; MAP >65 with norepi
   - Monitor device flows, wean as tolerated
   - Daily TTE to assess LV recovery
   - Serial lactate, end-organ markers
   - Consider IABP/ECMO if no improvement
   - Cardiology to follow

2. **Sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia**
   - Cefepime + azithromycin started (2/1)
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures pending
   - Monitor for de-escalation once sensitivities available

3. **Acute on Chronic Anemia**
   - Baseline hgb 10-11; now 8.1, likely dilutional + GI loss (occult blood +)
   - 1 unit PRBCs transfused 2/2 AM
   - Monitor for further drops, trend retic, iron studies

4. **Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure**
   - On 2L NC, improving oxygenation
   - Incentive spirometry, pulmonary hygiene
   - Monitor for escalation

5. **Alzheimer’s Dementia (severe)**
   - MMSE not feasible; baseline nonverbal
   - Continue cholinesterase inhibitors; monitor for delirium

6. **Hyperlipidemia**
   - Continue simvastatin

7. **Prediabetes**
   - Glucose mostly <150, no insulin required

8. **Electrolyte Abnormalities**
   - Mild hyponatremia, K trending down (replete if <4)
   - Monitor Mg, Phos (last: Mg 1.8, Phos 2.1)

9. **AKI (prerenal, likely from shock)**
   - Creatinine uptrending (0.4 → 1.1)
   - Monitor UOP, avoid nephrotoxins

10. **Pressure Injury, Sacrum (stage 1)**
    - Wound care, frequent turns

11. **Pain/Comfort**
    - Acetaminophen prn, goal comfort

12. **Advanced Care Planning**
    - Discussed goals of care with family; remains full code

---

**Consults:**  
- Cardiology (Impella)  
- Infectious Disease (pending)  
- Nutrition (high-calorie, high-protein diet)

---

**To Do:**
- Daily labs (CBC, lytes, lactate, trop)
- Monitor Impella site for bleeding/infection
- Family update daily
- Continue supportive care

**Patient:** Feil, Ivan  
**MRN:** 01487213  
**DOB:** 05/06/1957 (67 years)  
**Sex:** Male  
**Date of Service:** 2024-06-22  
**Attending:** Dr. S. Martens  
**Admitting Dx:** Cardiogenic shock secondary to acute decompensated heart failure.  
**Current Location:** CVC-ICU, Bed 5

---

**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**  
Shortness of breath and chest tightness x 3 days.

---

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  
67-year-old male with history of obesity (BMI 30+), hyperlipidemia, and recent viral respiratory illness (acute bronchitis, viral sinusitis), presenting with progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Symptoms worsened over 48 hours with acute chest tightness, diaphoresis, and near-syncope at home. Brought in by EMS, found to be hypotensive (SBP 76 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 122), and hypoxic (SpO2 89% on RA). ECG with new LBBB, troponin mildly elevated. Bedside echo: severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, moderate MR. Admitted to ICU for management of cardiogenic shock. Rapid escalation of inotropes/vasopressors, IABP placed on day 1; subsequently transitioned to Impella CP on day 2 for ongoing hemodynamic compromise.

**HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:**  
- Day 1: Presentation w/ cardiogenic shock, started norepinephrine, dobutamine. IABP placed.  
- Day 2: Ongoing shock, rising lactate, transitioned to Impella CP. Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  
- Day 3: Gradual improvement, weaned off norepinephrine, down-titrating dobutamine.  
- Day 4: LFTs peaked (congestive hepatopathy), mild AKI.  
- Day 5: Impella weaned, LVEF improved to 25%.  
- Day 6: Extubated, transitioned to diuresis, started low-dose beta-blocker.

# Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**  
- Etiology: Likely viral myocarditis vs. ischemic insult (troponin 0.33 → 0.25, no obstructive CAD on angio)  
- Temp. mechanical support: IABP → Impella CP, now weaned off  
- IV diuresis (furosemide), goal negative fluid balance  
- TTE: LVEF 15% → 25%, global hypokinesis  
- Monitoring: Telemetry, daily weights, strict I/O  
- Plan: Continue GDMT up-titration, consider cardiac MRI as outpatient

**2. Respiratory Failure**  
- Intubated for hypoxemia day 2  
- CXR: bibasilar atelectasis, mild pulmonary edema  
- Extubated day 6, now on 2L O2 nasal cannula  
- Plan: Pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry, monitor for re-intubation

**3. Obesity (BMI 30+)**  
- Nutritional consult  
- Calorie-restricted, cardiac diet  
- Encourage early mobilization as tolerated

**4. Acute Kidney Injury (Stage 1, multifactorial: low perfusion, diuretics)**  
- Peak Cr 1.7 (baseline 1.0), trending down  
- Monitored lytes, held ACEi  
- Plan: Renal dosing of meds, avoid nephrotoxins

**5. Transaminitis / Congestive Hepatopathy**  
- AST/ALT peaked day 4, improved with hemodynamics  
- Monitor LFTs, supportive care

**6. Recent acute bronchitis and viral sinusitis**  
- Resolved prior to admission  
- No current evidence of infection

**7. Pain management**  
- Acetaminophen PRN  
- Avoid NSAIDs due to cardiorenal risk

**8. DVT Prophylaxis**  
- SCDs, SQ heparin 5000u q8h

**9. Hyperlipidemia**  
- Hold statin for LFTs, restart once normalized

**10. Disposition**  
- Pending PT/OT eval  
- Anticipate transfer to cardiac stepdown in 24-48h

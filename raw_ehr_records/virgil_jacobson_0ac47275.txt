### Chief Complaint
Progressive SOB, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema, found to be hypotensive and hypoxic in the ED.

---

### HPI
Virgil Jacobson is a 50-year-old obese male with a history of hyperlipidemia, gout, and recent acute bronchitis, who presented to the ED with a 4-day history of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough, and lower extremity swelling. He had subjective fevers and chills at home and endorsed chest tightness and palpitations. He was found to be hypotensive (SBP 78 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 132), hypoxic (SpO2 87% on RA). CXR showed pulmonary edema. Troponin elevated at 1.8, BNP 2450. Echo in ED showed severely reduced LVEF (15%), global hypokinesis, moderate MR. Patient acutely decompensated on hospital day 1 with worsening shock and lactic acidosis (lactate 5.6), requiring norepinephrine and dobutamine. Emergent Impella CP placement performed for cardiogenic shock. Since then, he has been in the Cardiac ICU, weaned off vasopressors, and is now being evaluated for advanced therapies.

## Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock, s/p Impella CP (temporary LVAD)  
**Assessment:** Cardiogenic shock secondary to new severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Required temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP). Now hemodynamically stable, off pressors, Impella wean underway.  
**Plan:**  
- Continue Impella CP wean per protocol  
- Daily TTE for LV function  
- Monitor for hemolysis, limb ischemia, device malfunction  
- Consider advanced heart failure therapies (LVAD, transplant eval)  
- ACE-I/BB to be started when stable  
- Strict I/O, daily weights  
- Telemetry  
- Cardiology, HF, and CT surgery involved

### 2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure  
**Assessment:** Severe LV dysfunction, pulmonary edema, improved with diuresis and mechanical support  
**Plan:**  
- Continue IV furosemide, titrate to euvolemia  
- Salt/fluid restriction  
- Monitor for electrolyte disturbances  
- Titrate HF meds as tolerated

### 3. Acute Kidney Injury, resolving  
**Assessment:** Likely due to hypoperfusion secondary to shock, improved post-Impella  
**Plan:**  
- Monitor renal function qAM  
- Avoid nephrotoxins  
- Adjust meds for renal function  
- Nephrology consult prn

### 4. Hyperlipidemia  
**Assessment:** Chronic, LDL elevated, on statin  
**Plan:**  
- Continue simvastatin  
- Monitor LFTs  

### 5. Obesity (BMI 30+)  
**Assessment:** Modifiable risk factor for heart disease  
**Plan:**  
- Dietician consult  
- Discuss weight management post-acute illness  

### 6. Gout  
**Assessment:** On allopurinol, no recent flare  
**Plan:**  
- Continue current regimen  
- Avoid nephrotoxic agents  

### 7. Acute Bronchitis (recent)  
**Assessment:** Likely resolved; no evidence of superimposed pneumonia  
**Plan:**  
- Monitor for secondary infection  
- Pulmonary toilet  

### 8. Facial Laceration (remote, s/p repair)  
**Assessment:** Well healed  
**Plan:**  
- No acute intervention  

### 9. DVT Prophylaxis  
**Plan:**  
- SCDs in place  
- Enoxaparin 40mg SQ daily  

### 10. Pain  
**Plan:**  
- Acetaminophen prn  
- Avoid NSAIDs (renal function, HF)  

---

### Disposition
- Remains in Cardiac ICU for Impella management and advanced heart failure evaluation.
- If stable, transfer to cardiac step-down unit anticipated in 1-2 days.

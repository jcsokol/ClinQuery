## **HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY**

Mr. Carson Wolf, a 77-year-old male with a complex medical history including hypertension, prediabetes, chronic anemia, epilepsy, and chronic sinusitis, was admitted to the ICU on 4/18/24 for acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock secondary to suspected viral myocarditis. His hospital course was complicated by multiorgan dysfunction, GI bleeding, and protracted diarrhea. During the course of his ICU stay, he required placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

---

## **CHIEF COMPLAINT**
Shortness of breath, chest pain, and protracted diarrhea.

---

## **HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**

Mr. Wolf presented from home with 1 week of worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema, associated with low-grade fevers, non-productive cough, and persistent diarrhea (7-8 watery stools/day). He also endorsed intermittent chest discomfort, generalized weakness, and anorexia. He denied sick contacts, recent travel, or known COVID exposure. On arrival, he was hypotensive (BP 84/52), tachycardic (HR 115), tachypneic (RR 25), and hypoxic (O2 sat 89% on RA), with evidence of volume overload.

---

## **PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute Decompensated HF**
   - Likely viral myocarditis, possible ischemic component
   - Required Impella CP support (ICU day 3-10)
   - Diuresed after stabilization, uptitrated GDMT
   - Plan: Continue HF regimen, monitor for recurrent decompensation, follow up echo

**2. GI Bleeding / Ischemic Colitis**
   - Melena, Hgb drop, EGD negative, CT suggestive ischemic colitis
   - Supportive care, transfused 2U PRBCs, held anticoagulation
   - Plan: Resume DVT ppx once stable, GI follow-up

**3. Protracted Diarrhea**
   - Infectious w/u negative, likely ischemic-related
   - Improved with bowel rest and supportive care
   - Plan: Advance diet as tolerated, replete lytes

**4. AKI, Multi-Organ Dysfunction**
   - Pre-renal with component of ATN, resolved with improved perfusion
   - Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins

**5. Chronic Anemia**
   - Baseline Hgb ~11, down to 8.8 with GI bleed
   - Plan: Close monitoring, iron studies outpatient

**6. Seizure Disorder / Encephalopathy**
   - On carbamazepine, no witnessed seizures this admission
   - Delirium likely multifactorial (ICU, metabolic, infection)
   - Plan: Maintain AEDs, minimize sedation, neuro consult if worsens

**7. HTN, Prediabetes**
   - Restarted home meds after stabilization
   - Plan: Monitor BP/Glucose, outpatient follow-up

**8. Chronic Sinusitis / Recurrent URIs**
   - No acute intervention needed, continue outpatient f/u

**9. Chronic Pain, Hx Wrist Fx**
   - PRN acetaminophen, avoid NSAIDs due to GI and renal risk

**10. Functional Decline / Rehab Needs**
   - Deconditioned after prolonged ICU stay
   - Plan: PT/OT, assess for SNF placement

---

## **DISCHARGE PLANNING**
- Anticipated discharge to SNF for rehab
- Cardiology, GI, Neurology follow-up
- Medication reconciliation pending

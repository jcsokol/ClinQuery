### **Chief Complaint**
Shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest discomfort

---

### **History of Present Illness**

Mr. Kareem Brakus, a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obesity (BMI 30), epilepsy (on chronic AEDs), osteoporosis, and chronic/viral sinusitis, presented to the ED with acute onset of progressive dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and chest heaviness for 2 days. He reported worsening lower extremity edema, decreased exercise tolerance, and two episodes of near-syncope. No fevers or cough. No recent seizure activity per family.

In the ED, he was found to be hypertensive (BP 178/99), tachycardic (HR 116), hypoxic (O2 sat 88% RA), and in moderate respiratory distress. ECG showed NSR with LVH and nonspecific ST-T changes. CXR: pulmonary vascular congestion, mild bilateral effusions. Troponin I was mildly elevated. BNP 2120. Echo: LVEF 15% with global hypokinesis. He developed worsening hypotension and hypoperfusion despite diuresis and afterload reduction. Cardiogenic shock was diagnosed and he was transferred to MICU for vasopressor support. Given persistent shock, a percutaneous left-sided temporary mechanical circulatory support device (Impella CP) was placed at bedside on hospital day 2.

### **Hospital Course (Summarized by Day)**

**Day 1 (Admission):**  
- Admitted for acute decompensated heart failure (newly reduced EF) and cardiogenic shock.  
- Started on IV furosemide, nitroglycerin drip, supplemental O2.  
- Initial labs: AKI (Cr 1.8), mild transaminitis, lactic acidosis (lactate 3.5), troponin 0.19 → 0.25.  
- EEG negative for seizure, maintained on levetiracetam.  
- BP labile, MAP <65 at times.

**Day 2:**  
- Worsening shock, escalating norepinephrine and vasopressin.  
- Impella CP placed via right femoral artery without complications.  
- Improved MAP, urine output, lactic acid downtrending.  
- Started empiric antibiotics for possible aspiration (ceftriaxone, azithro).

**Day 3-5:**  
- Slow improvement.  
- Weaned off vasopressors by day 4.  
- Impella weaned and explanted on day 5.  
- Renal function improved.  
- Diuresis continued.  
- Developed mild delirium, likely multifactorial (ICU, metabolic).

**Day 6-8:**  
- Stepped down to CCU.  
- Transitioned to oral HF regimen (metoprolol, sacubitril-valsartan, spironolactone).  
- Mobilized with PT.  
- Bone health re-addressed (alendronate resumed), DEXA confirmed osteoporosis.  
- No further seizure activity.  
- Persistent mild nasal congestion (chronic sinusitis).

### **Assessment & Plan (problem-based)**

---

**1. Cardiogenic Shock (newly reduced EF, acute decompensated HF)**
   - Etiology likely ischemic vs. viral myocarditis.
   - Required temporary mechanical support (Impella CP) days 2-5.
   - Now off vasopressors, Impella explanted, stable on medical therapy.
   - Plan: Continue uptitration of GDMT, monitor volume status, f/u outpatient advanced heart failure.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**
   - Pre-renal etiology from shock.
   - Improved with restoration of perfusion and diuresis.
   - Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins.

**3. Epilepsy (hx of single seizure, no recent events)**
   - Maintained on levetiracetam, no events during hospitalization.
   - EEG negative.
   - Plan: Continue home AED, neurology to f/u.

**4. Hypertension**
   - Previously poorly controlled, now on optimized regimen.
   - Plan: Continue current BP meds, monitor for hypotension.

**5. Obesity (BMI 30)**
   - Contributing to HF.
   - Plan: Nutrition consult, encourage weight loss, PT/OT.

**6. Osteoporosis**
   - DEXA T-score -3.06.
   - Plan: Continue alendronate, calcium/vitamin D, PT for fall prevention.

**7. Chronic sinusitis**
   - Mild symptoms, no acute infection.
   - Plan: Continue nasal saline, f/u with ENT as outpatient.

**8. Hyperlipidemia**
   - On statin, well controlled.
   - Plan: Continue atorvastatin.

**9. Delirium (resolved)**
   - Likely multifactorial, resolved with metabolic stabilization.
   - Plan: Monitor mental status, minimize sedatives.

**10. Hospital-acquired constipation**
   - On bowel regimen.
   - Plan: Continue docusate, monitor BM.

---

### **Discharge Planning**
- Anticipated discharge home in 1-2 days.
- Close f/u with HF clinic, neurology, and PCP.
- Home health PT/OT arranged.
- Spouse educated on s/sx of decompensation.

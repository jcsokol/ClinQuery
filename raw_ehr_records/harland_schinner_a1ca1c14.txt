## Subjective:
Harland Schinner is a 31-year-old male with PMHx notable for recent viral sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and no significant cardiac history, who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest tightness. He was initially being treated as an outpatient for URI symptoms but developed profound fatigue, palpitations, and an episode of near-syncope. He was found to be hypotensive (SBP: 80s mmHg), tachycardic, and hypoxic on room air.  

On admission, he reported 8/10 chest discomfort, severe shortness of breath, and mild confusion. Since admission, he has been intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and required escalating pressor support. Family at bedside.

### Hospital Course Summary

- **Day 1-2:** Rapid decompensation requiring intubation and norepinephrine, then vasopressin. Echo confirmed severe LV dysfunction. Multidisciplinary decision for placement of temporary percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) on 4/22 for refractory cardiogenic shock.
- **Day 2-4:** Gradual improvement in hemodynamics, weaned off vasopressors. Impella support for 60 hours. Complicated by mild hemolysis (dark urine, elevated LDH, falling haptoglobin). Renal function transiently worsened, improved after volume optimization.
- **Day 4:** Impella weaned, explanted at bedside. No device-related infection, no significant vascular complications.
- **Day 5:** Extubated, transitioned to high-flow nasal cannula, then room air. Neurologically intact.

## Assessment & Plan

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, likely secondary to acute viral myocarditis (Coxsackie B)**
- Required temporary LVAD (Impella) for 60h, now explanted.
- LVEF improving (now 32%).
- Plan: Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF (carvedilol, low-dose lisinopril), monitor telemetry, daily weights, strict I/O. Cardiology f/u.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO stage 2, likely multifactorial)**
- Likely pre-renal from low output, possible hemolysis.
- Trending improved (Cr: 2.1 → 1.2).
- Plan: Monitor renal panel, avoid nephrotoxins, maintain euvolemia.

**3. Transient Hemolysis (Impella-associated)**
- Resolved after device removal.
- Plan: Monitor Hgb, LDH, haptoglobin.

**4. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure**
- Intubated days 1-4, now extubated.
- Weaning O2, pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry.

**5. Viral Sinusitis/Bronchitis**
- Supportive care, no antibiotics.
- Symptoms improving.

**6. Pain, mild**
- PRN acetaminophen.

**7. Vascular Access**
- Left femoral arterial and venous lines for device and monitoring, removed without complication.

**8. Nutrition**
- Enteral nutrition while intubated, now on cardiac diet.

**9. DVT prophylaxis**
- SCDs, SQ heparin.

**10. Disposition**
- Stepdown when stable, anticipate transfer in 24-48h.
- Outpatient f/u: Cardiology, PCP, repeat TTE in 2-4 weeks.

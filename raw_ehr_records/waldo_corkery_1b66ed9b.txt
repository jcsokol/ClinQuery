**Epic EHR - Patient Chart**

**Patient Name:** Waldo Corkery  
**MRN:** 00947328  
**Date of Birth:** 07/15/1992  
**Sex:** Male  
**Admit Date:** 04/11/2024  
**Attending:** Dr. Jennifer M. Hsu  
**Location:** CVICU, Rm 4B-22  
**Code Status:** Full code  
**Allergies:** NKDA  
**History of Present Illness:**  
29-year-old male with a history notable for obesity (BMI ~30), recurrent pharyngitis and sinusitis, presenting from home with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He reported preceding viral URI symptoms (rhinorrhea, sore throat) 1 week prior, treated as outpatient with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Over 24 hours prior to admission, developed chest tightness, diaphoresis, and worsening shortness of breath. Collapsed at home, EMS found hypotensive, tachycardic, and hypoxic; brought to ED. Initial evaluation concerning for acute decompensated heart failure with possible viral myocarditis.

In the ED, patient became increasingly hypotensive and hypoxic, requiring intubation and vasopressor support. Bedside echo showed severe global LV dysfunction (EF 10-15%), moderate RV dysfunction, and moderate MR. He was transferred to CVICU where he developed refractory cardiogenic shock, requiring placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for mechanical circulatory support on hospital day 2. He has since stabilized on MCS, with ongoing diuresis and slow improvement in end-organ function.

## Hospital Course Summary

### Day 1 (04/11/24):
- Admitted to ED with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, and signs of low cardiac output.
- Labs notable for elevated troponin (0.34 → 1.2 ng/mL), BNP 3200 pg/mL, lactate 4.2 mmol/L, mild transaminitis.
- CXR: Pulmonary edema, enlarged cardiac silhouette.
- TTE: EF 10-15%, non-dilated LV, global hypokinesis, moderate MR, mild pericardial effusion.
- Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, started on norepinephrine and dobutamine.

### Day 2:
- Worsening shock despite escalating vasopressors/inotropes.
- Decision made for percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for temporary support.
- Insertion uneventful; rapid improvement in MAP and urine output.
- Started on furosemide drip, uptitrated to maintain negative fluid balance.

### Day 3-6:
- Gradual improvement in end-organ perfusion.
- LFTs and creatinine trending down.
- Successfully weaned off norepinephrine by day 4.
- Ongoing diuresis, net negative 5.2L since admission.
- Serial TTEs showing slow improvement in LV function (EF up to 20% by day 5).

### Day 7:
- Started on low-dose carvedilol and sacubitril/valsartan.
- Impella weaned and removed on day 7 after repeat TTE confirmed improved cardiac output and stable hemodynamics.
- Extubated to nasal cannula, tolerating well.

---

## Assessment & Plan

### 1. **Acute Fulminant Viral Myocarditis with Cardiogenic Shock**
- Likely viral etiology (recent URI prodrome, negative ischemic workup)
- Required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for refractory shock.
- Now improved, Impella removed post-stabilization.
- Plan: Monitor for arrhythmias, continue guideline-directed HF therapy, follow-up echo prior to transfer.

### 2. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure**
- Severe LV systolic dysfunction, now improved to EF 20%.
- On diuretics, now euvolemic.
- Started on low-dose beta-blocker, ARNI, and spironolactone.
- Plan: Slow uptitration as tolerated, daily weights, strict I/Os.

### 3. **Obesity**
- BMI 30.7, 95th percentile.
- Counseling provided; nutrition consult placed.
- Plan: Monitor weight, encourage PT/OT, dietary modification.

### 4. **Acute Kidney Injury, resolving**
- Likely pre-renal from low cardiac output, Cr peaked at 2.0 now 1.1.
- Plan: Monitor UOP, renal function, avoid nephrotoxins.

### 5. **Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
- Intubated for 6 days, now extubated.
- Plan: Incentive spirometry, pulmonary hygiene.

### 6. **Transaminitis**
- AST/ALT peaked at 320/210, now trending down.
- Likely ischemic hepatitis from shock.
- Plan: Monitor LFTs.

### 7. **History of recurrent pharyngitis/sinusitis**
- No active infection.
- Plan: Outpatient ENT follow-up.

### 8. **Hyperlipidemia**
- LDL 148, TG 210 on admission.
- Plan: Statin started.

### 9. **Anemia of critical illness**
- Hgb nadir 9.4 on day 5.
- Plan: Monitor, iron studies pending.

### 10. **Electrolyte disturbances**
- Hypokalemia (K+ 3.1), hypomagnesemia (Mg 1.5) on day 3, corrected.
- Plan: Replete as needed.

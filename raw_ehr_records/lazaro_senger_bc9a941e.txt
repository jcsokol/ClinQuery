### HOSPITAL COURSE  
**ICU Day 1:**  
- Rapid deterioration with hypotension refractory to fluids, started on norepinephrine, then dobutamine for low-output state.  
- Bedside echo: severe LV dysfunction, no RV dilation, no tamponade.  
- Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  
- Swan-Ganz: CI 1.5, PCWP 27, SVR 1400.  
- Decision made to place temporary percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock.  
- Started broad-spectrum abx for possible myocarditis.  
- Serial cardiac markers, CBC, BMP, LFTs, coags, lactate monitored.  
- Foley, A-line, central line placed.

**ICU Days 2-5:**  
- Responded to LVAD support, weaned off vasopressors by day 4.  
- Troponin peaked, then declined.  
- Developed transient AKI (creatinine 2.1) resolving with improved perfusion.  
- Mild transaminitis.  
- Extubated on day 5.  
- LVAD weaned off on day 6 after echo showed LVEF improved to 35%.

**ICU Days 6-10:**  
- Transferred to stepdown.  
- Diuresed for persistent congestion.  
- Initiated GDMT for heart failure: low-dose carvedilol, started sacubitril/valsartan.  
- Monitored for arrhythmias (none significant).  
- Infectious w/u negative for bacteria; viral PCR positive for Coxsackie B.

### ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to suspected viral myocarditis (Coxsackie B)**
   - Placed on temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.
   - Vasopressors/inotropes for initial stabilization, now weaned.
   - Serial cardiac markers, echo monitoring.
   - Plan: Continue GDMT for HF, close follow-up with heart failure and transplant team.

**2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure**
   - Required mechanical ventilation, now extubated.
   - Diuresed for pulmonary edema.
   - Plan: Continue O2 as needed, monitor for recurrence.

**3. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)**
   - Likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
   - Improved with restoration of cardiac output.
   - Plan: Monitor renal function.

**4. Transaminitis**
   - Likely ischemic hepatitis due to shock.
   - Trending down.
   - Plan: Monitor LFTs.

**5. Hypertension**
   - Hold home antihypertensives during shock.
   - Re-initiate as tolerated, currently on low-dose carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan.
   - Plan: Titrate as BP allows.

**6. Recent viral pharyngitis, chronic sinusitis**
   - No evidence of secondary bacterial infection.
   - Plan: Symptomatic management.

**7. Thromboprophylaxis**
   - On LMWH for DVT prophylaxis while on LVAD.

**8. Nutrition**
   - NGT feeds in ICU, now transitioned to PO diet.

**9. Disposition**
   - Anticipate transfer to rehab for cardiac recovery.

### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Altered mental status, shortness of breath, and chest pain.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Stephan Wolf is a 61-year-old male with PMHx significant for chronic migraines, chronic pain, hyperlipidemia, CKD (not formally diagnosed, but baseline Cr >2 per outside records), and recent viral pharyngitis/sinusitis. He was brought to ED by EMS after being found minimally responsive at home by his wife. Per report, he had been complaining of worsening headache, cough, and congestion for 1 week, but acutely developed severe chest pain and dyspnea. On arrival, he was tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic, requiring intubation and vasopressors. He subsequently developed cardiogenic shock and acute renal injury. Emergent echo showed severely depressed LVEF (~15%), with global hypokinesis, and no acute valvular pathology. Emergent left-sided Impella CP placement was performed for hemodynamic support.

---

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

- **Day 1:** Admitted to ICU, intubated, on norepinephrine, Impella CP placed for refractory cardiogenic shock.  
- **Day 2:** Remained intubated, minimal improvement. Oliguric, Cr peaked at 4.1.  
- **Day 3:** Weaned norepi, Impella flows 3.2-3.6 L/min. Cardiac markers trending down. Developed fever, started broad-spectrum abx.  
- **Day 4:** Neuro status improved, extubated. Renal function improving with diuresis.  
- **Day 5:** Impella weaned, explanted. Down to nasal cannula O2.  
- **Day 6:** Stable, transferred to step-down.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN (PROBLEM-BASED)

**1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to acute myocarditis (suspected viral)**
   - Impella CP placed for hemodynamic support, explanted day 5
   - Serial echo, daily labs, telemetry
   - Diuresis as tolerated, avoid volume overload
   - Continue GDMT (hold beta-blocker until off inotropes)

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (on CKD)**
   - Likely multifactorial (low flow, nephrotoxins, sepsis)
   - IV fluids (early), then diuresis as improved
   - Renal dose dopamine not used
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose all meds
   - Nephrology following

**3. Acute on chronic pain / migraine**
   - Oxycodone PRN, scheduled acetaminophen
   - Sumatriptan held during acute cardiac event
   - Pain service consulted

**4. Hyperlipidemia**
   - Simvastatin continued

**5. Acute viral pharyngitis/sinusitis**
   - Supportive care, no antibiotics indicated (rhinovirus)
   - ENT consulted for recurrent episodes

**6. Drug Overdose History**
   - No acute intoxication on tox screen
   - Monitored for withdrawal

**7. Impacted molars**
   - No acute intervention needed, outpatient dental follow-up

**8. Nutrition**
   - Started tube feeds during intubation, transitioned to oral as tolerated

**9. DVT prophylaxis**
   - SCDs on, heparin SQ started day 3 post-Impella

**10. Disposition**
   - Step-down unit, anticipate transfer to floor in 2-3 days if stable

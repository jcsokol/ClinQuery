Chief Complaint:
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest pain x 2 days.

HPI:
29-year-old female with PMH notable for ADHD, chronic/viral sinusitis, remote ankle sprain, G2P2 (uncomplicated), presents with acute-on-chronic dyspnea, chest tightness, and fatigue. She was in usual health until 48 hours prior to admission, when she developed severe SOB and palpitations. She collapsed at home, was found to be hypotensive and tachycardic by EMS, and was brought to ED. Initial workup showed elevated troponin, BNP, and severe LVEF reduction on echo. She was transferred to CICU for cardiogenic shock, requiring inotropes, vasopressors, and subsequently a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed for hemodynamic support. No prior cardiac history.

Hospital Course (Days 1-5):
- Day 1: Hypotensive, requiring norepinephrine + dobutamine. Lactate 4.2. TTE: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis, no valvular vegetations.
- Day 2: Impella placed. Improved MAP, weaned norepinephrine. Developed mild hemolysis (LDH up), transient hematuria.
- Day 3: Improved urine output. Downtrending troponin. Mild transaminitis.
- Day 4: Mobilized to chair. Impella flows maintained. Ongoing low-grade fever, cultures sent.
- Day 5: Stable, weaning inotropes, off pressors. Impella explant planned.

PMH:
- ADHD (childhood)
- Chronic sinusitis
- Viral sinusitis (multiple episodes)
- Acute bronchitis (remote)
- Sprain of ankle (remote)
- 2 prior full-term pregnancies, both uncomplicated

PSH: None
Allergies: NKDA

Meds on Admission:
- Etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon), OCPs (Natazia, Trinessa, Yaz, Seasonique, Levora) â€“ last dose unclear
- Acetaminophen PRN
- Naproxen PRN

Social:
- Lives with partner, 2 children. No tobacco, EtOH, or illicit drug use.

Family History:
- Mother: HTN, DM2
- Father: MI age 51

Physical Exam (04/21/2024, 08:00):
Gen: Tired, NAD, on cardiac monitor, Impella in situ
VS: T 37.6C, HR 98, BP 112/72 (MAP 85), RR 17, SpO2 97% RA
CV: S1/S2, no murmurs, Impella hum, JVP 8cm, no edema
Pulm: Clear, no rales/wheezes, good air entry
Abd: Soft, NT, no HSM
Ext: No DVT, pulses 2+, Impella site C/D/I

Micro:
- Blood cx x2 (4/17): No growth at 72h
- Urine cx (4/17): No growth

Imaging:
- EKG: Sinus tachycardia, non-specific ST-T changes
- Echo (4/16): LVEF ~15%, severe global hypokinesis, mild MR, no thrombus
- CXR: Mild pulmonary edema, no consolidation

Procedures:
- 4/17: Impella CP placement via R femoral artery (see procedure note)
- 4/18: Foley d/c, ambulated to chair

Assessment & Plan:

1. **Cardiogenic Shock, New Onset, likely Myocarditis vs. Peripartum CMP**
   - Severe LV dysfunction (LVEF 15%), shock requiring Impella + inotropes
   - Downtrending troponin & BNP, improving end-organ perfusion
   - Plan: Continue supportive care, Impella explant when stable, monitor for arrhythmias, daily TTE for weaning

2. **Hemolysis, mild (secondary to Impella)**
   - LDH peaked at 820, downtrending, no schistocytes, haptoglobin low
   - Plan: Monitor labs, maintain flows <4 L/min, transfuse if Hgb <8

3. **Acute Kidney Injury, resolving**
   - Cr up to 1.4, improved to 0.9, likely pre-renal
   - Plan: IVF as tolerated, monitor UOP, avoid nephrotoxins

4. **Transaminitis, mild**
   - AST/ALT peaked at 77/68, now improving
   - Plan: Monitor, likely ischemic, no further workup unless worsens

5. **Fever, low grade, workup negative**
   - Cultures negative, likely device-related inflammation
   - Plan: Monitor, no abx at this time

6. **Contraceptive Management**
   - Multiple OCPs/implant, not related to acute presentation
   - Plan: Hold OCPs inpatient due to VTE risk, counsel on contraception post-discharge

7. **Chronic/viral sinusitis, ADHD, remote ankle sprain, prior pregnancies**
   - No acute issues

Disposition:
- Remain in CICU. Anticipate Impella explant in next 24-48h if stable.
- Cardiac MRI planned for etiology.
- PT/OT to evaluate for deconditioning.

Signout/To Do:
- Wean inotropes as tolerated
- Monitor for bleeding/hemolysis
- Repeat labs q24h
- Family meeting re: prognosis

Additional Notes:

04/18/2024 15:44 - Nursing Note: Pt alert, oriented, tolerating clear liquids, Impella site intact, minimal drainage

04/19/2024 09:12 - Cardiology Consult: Etiology unclear, consider myocarditis vs. peripartum CMP, recommend MRI

04/20/2024 17:33 - Social Work: Discussed support at home, has strong family network

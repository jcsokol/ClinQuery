## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**HPI:**  
24-year-old female with a history of hypertension (on multiple antihypertensives) and recent upper respiratory tract infections, presented with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, non-productive cough, and malaise. She reported pleuritic chest discomfort, palpitations, and presyncopal episodes at home. On arrival, she was hypotensive (BP 82/49 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 126), with cool extremities and JVD. CXR showed pulmonary edema; bedside echo: severely reduced LVEF (~20%), global hypokinesis, mild LV dilatation. Labs notable for elevated BNP, troponin I, mild AKI.

Patient developed worsening hemodynamic instability within hours of presentation. She was transferred to the MICU and started on dobutamine and norepinephrine. Due to refractory shock, emergently underwent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for temporary mechanical circulatory support. She gradually stabilized over the next 6 days, device weaned and removed on day 7. Complicated by transient AKI and mild transaminitis. Weaned off pressors by day 8. Serial ECHO showed partial recovery of LVEF to 35%. Discharge planning ongoing.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure with Cardiogenic Shock
- **Assessment:** 24F with known HTN, presenting with new severe LV dysfunction (likely viral myocarditis vs. idiopathic). Required Impella CP for refractory shock; improved with support, now off device.
- **Plan:**
  - Continue aggressive diuresis (IV furosemide)
  - Cardiology to follow; consider cardiac MRI after stabilization
  - Monitor for arrhythmias, low threshold for repeat ECHO
  - Titrate down inotropes as tolerated (off as of 3/16)
  - Daily weights, I/Os, fluid restriction

### 2. Hypertension
- **Assessment:** Pre-existing, complicated by recent decompensation. Off oral antihypertensives during shock phase.
- **Plan:**
  - Resume home antihypertensives as tolerated (amlodipine, HCTZ, olmesartan)
  - Monitor BP closely
  - Avoid hypotension

### 3. Acute Bronchitis / Viral Pharyngitis / Streptococcal Pharyngitis / Sinusitis
- **Assessment:** Recent viral URI, treated with Pen VK; symptoms improving.
- **Plan:**
  - Supportive care (acetaminophen prn, hydration)
  - Continue antibiotics to completion
  - Monitor for secondary bacterial infection

### 4. Acute Kidney Injury
- **Assessment:** Likely multifactorial (low output, pressors, nephrotoxic meds).
- **Plan:**
  - Renal dosing of all meds
  - Avoid nephrotoxins
  - Monitor daily labs, trend Cr/BUN
  - Nephrology consulted; improvement noted

### 5. Supraventricular Tachycardia
- **Assessment:** Occasional runs on telemetry, no sustained arrhythmia.
- **Plan:**
  - Continue telemetry
  - No intervention unless symptomatic

### 6. Hypotension, post-cardiac support
- **Assessment:** Improved after Impella wean, now stable.
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor MAP >65
  - IV fluids prn
  - Hold antihypertensives if hypotensive

### 7. Mild Transaminitis
- **Assessment:** Likely from shock liver, now resolving.
- **Plan:**
  - Trend LFTs
  - Avoid hepatotoxins

### 8. Contraceptive Management
- **Assessment:** Home OCPs, held during acute illness.
- **Plan:**
  - Hold until discharge, counsel re: VTE risk during recovery

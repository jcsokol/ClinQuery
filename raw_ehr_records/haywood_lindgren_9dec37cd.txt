### **Chief Complaint**
Shortness of breath, chest tightness, and fatigue

---

### **History of Present Illness**
Haywood Lindgren is a 34-year-old male with a history notable for prediabetes, chronic anemia, and recurrent upper respiratory infections (including viral sinusitis and acute bronchitis), who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and intermittent chest pain. He reports a recent upper respiratory infection with low-grade fevers and cough, treated with acetaminophen and amox-clav at home. No prior history of structural heart disease or known CAD.

In the ED, he was tachypneic, tachycardic, and hypoxic (O2 sat 88% on room air). Initial labs revealed acute renal impairment and elevated cardiac biomarkers. CXR showed pulmonary edema. EKG: sinus tachy, non-specific ST/T changes. Troponin I elevated at 2.1 ng/mL. BNP 3500 pg/mL. TTE: LVEF 18%, global hypokinesis, no valvular vegetations, moderate MR.

He rapidly deteriorated, requiring BiPAP, then intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. Despite medical therapy (IV lasix, dobutamine, nitroglycerin), he developed cardiogenic shock with escalating vasopressor/inotrope requirements. On hospital day 2, he was taken for placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

### **Home Medications**

---

### **Hospital Course Summary**
- **HD1:** Admitted with acute decompensated heart failure, hypoxic resp failure, likely viral myocarditis vs. ischemic etiology.  
- **HD2:** Worsening shock, required intubation, started on multiple vasoactive agents. Impella CP placed for temporary circulatory support.  
- **HD3-5:** Gradual improvement in organ perfusion. Weaned off vasopressors. Renal function improved with diuresis.  
- **HD6:** Impella weaned and explanted. Extubated. Now on low-flow nasal cannula, awake, interactive.  
- **HD7-8:** Transferred to stepdown. Ambulating with PT.

### **Review of Systems**
Unable to provide, intubated for most of admission.

### **Physical Exam**
**HD6 (post-extubation):**  
- **Gen:** Awake, alert, NAD  
- **CV:** Tachycardic, S3 present, no murmurs/rubs/gallops  
- **Pulm:** Bibasilar crackles, improved aeration  
- **Abd:** Soft, NT, ND  
- **Ext:** No edema, pulses 2+  
- **Neuro:** Oriented, moves all extremities

### **Assessment & Plan (Problem-Based)**

#### 1. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock, likely viral myocarditis**
   - Required Impella CP for hemodynamic support (HD2-6)
   - Weaned off vasopressors, now stable
   - Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): low-dose carvedilol, lisinopril if BP tolerates, spironolactone
   - Monitor for arrhythmias, volume status, renal function
   - Daily weights, strict I/O
   - Cardiology f/u

#### 2. **Severe Anemia (multifactorial, acute on chronic)**
   - Transfused 2u PRBCs HD2, improved Hgb
   - Monitor CBC daily
   - Iron studies pending

#### 3. **Acute Renal Injury (pre-renal, likely cardiorenal)**
   - Improved with diuresis, off pressors
   - Monitor renal function
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents

#### 4. **Respiratory Failure, s/p intubation/tracheal extubation**
   - Improving, on NC 2L
   - Incentive spirometry, PT/OT

#### 5. **Prediabetes**
   - Maintain euglycemia, monitor glucose
   - Endocrine consult

#### 6. **Recurrent URIs (viral sinusitis, bronchitis, pharyngitis)**
   - Currently no evidence of bacterial infection
   - Continue supportive care

#### 7. **Pain (mild, post-procedure)**
   - Acetaminophen PRN

#### 8. **DVT Prophylaxis**
   - SCDs, SQ heparin

#### 9. **Nutrition**
   - Renal/cardiac diet
   - Monitor labs/electrolytes

### **Discharge Planning**
- Anticipate transfer to acute rehab
- Cardiology, nephrology, primary care follow-up
- Medication reconciliation prior to discharge

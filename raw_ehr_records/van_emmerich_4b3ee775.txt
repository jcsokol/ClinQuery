**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity swelling.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  
Mr. Van Emmerich is an 89-year-old male with history of severe pulmonary emphysema, chronic pain from prior right ankle fracture, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the ED with 4 days of worsening dyspnea, productive cough, subjective fevers, and increased lower extremity edema. He also reported chest tightness and two episodes of near-syncope at home. On arrival, he was hypoxemic (SpO2 86% RA), tachycardic to 112, and hypertensive (BP 168/92). CXR revealed pulmonary vascular congestion and possible infiltrate. Initial labs were notable for elevated BNP and troponin. He was admitted to the ICU for acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure and decompensated heart failure.  

During hospitalization, he developed hypotension refractory to diuretics and inotropes, requiring temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) placement on HD 2 for cardiogenic shock.

**HD 3-5:**  
- Gradual improvement, weaned to 2L NC  
- Impella weaned and explanted HD 4  
- Diuresis continued, net negative 6L  
- Ankle pain managed with hydrocodone/acetaminophen  
- No arrhythmias, no new fevers

**PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN:**  

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Decompensated HF**  
   - Likely precipitated by viral URI + acute ischemia  
   - Impella CP for temporary LV support, explanted HD 4  
   - Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): ACEi, BB, statin  
   - Monitor for recurrent symptoms  
   - Outpt HF clinic f/u in 1 week  

**2. Pulmonary Emphysema (severe)**  
   - Continue inhaled LABA/ICS  
   - Pulmonary rehab referral  
   - SpO2 goal >88%  
   - Home O2 eval at discharge  

**3. Acute Viral Pharyngitis (recent, resolved)**  
   - No further intervention needed  

**4. Acute on Chronic Pain - Right Ankle**  
   - Continue hydrocodone/APAP PRN  
   - PT/OT for strengthening  

**5. Hyperlipidemia**  
   - Continue atorvastatin  
   - F/u lipid panel in 1 month  

**6. HTN**  
   - Restart lisinopril, monitor BP  

**7. Hospital Course Complications**  
   - No VTE, no arrhythmias, no AKI  
   - Foley removed HD 5, ambulating independently

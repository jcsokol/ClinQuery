## Admission H&P Summary

**Chief Complaint:**  
Acute onset dyspnea and chest pain, progressive orthopnea, and near-syncope at home.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. Rusty Beer is a 40-year-old male with history of perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis, who presented to the ED with 3 days of worsening shortness of breath, chest tightness, palpitations, and new lower extremity edema. Notably, he had a URI 2 weeks ago. In the ED, he was found to be tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic (SpO2 89% RA). CXR revealed bilateral pulmonary edema. TTE in the ED showed severely reduced LVEF ~15%, global hypokinesis, and moderate MR. He was emergently transferred to the CCU for management of acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock. Temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on HD#1 due to persistent hypotension and end-organ hypoperfusion.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Perennial allergic rhinitis  
- Chronic sinusitis  
- Viral sinusitis (frequent episodes)  
- No known CAD, DM, HTN

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Septoplasty (childhood)

**Medications on Admission:**  
- diphenhydramine 25 mg PO PRN  
- No chronic cardiac meds

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker, rare ETOH, no recreational drugs  
- Lives with partner, works as a plumber

**Family History:**  
- Father: MI at 54, alive  
- Mother: Asthma  
- No known genetic heart disease

## Physical Exam (Admission)

**General:** Ill-appearing, in mild distress  
**HEENT:** Sinus tenderness, clear oropharynx  
**CV:** Tachycardic, S3, soft systolic murmur at apex, JVD 10 cm  
**Resp:** Tachypnea, diffuse rales  
**Abd:** Soft, mild hepatomegaly  
**Ext:** 2+ pitting edema to knees bilat  
**Neuro:** Alert, oriented x3

**HD#1:**  
- Transferred to ICU, placed on norepinephrine and dobutamine for cardiogenic shock  
- Impella CP placed via right femoral artery  
- Swan-Ganz: CI 1.6, wedge 28, SVR 2100

## Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock (Resolved)
- Etiology: Likely viral myocarditis (recent URI, no CAD)
- Temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placed HD#1, explanted HD#5
- Vasopressors/inotropes weaned off by HD#3
- Serial ECHOs, hemodynamics monitored
- Plan: Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), close outpatient follow-up, consider cardiac MRI as outpatient

### 2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure, new HFrEF
- Started on carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan, spironolactone, furosemide
- Strict I/O, daily weights, sodium restriction
- Plan: Up-titrate GDMT, referral to advanced HF if no improvement

### 3. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (resolved)
- Required intubation for 48h, now extubated, on 2L NC
- Plan: Pulmonary hygiene, incentive spirometry

### 4. Sinusitis/Allergic Rhinitis
- ENT consulted, nasal steroids and saline rinses started
- Plan: F/U as outpatient, avoid triggers

### 5. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)
- Likely pre-renal from low cardiac output, Cr 1.8→1.2
- Plan: Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins

### 6. Possible Sepsis (ruled out)
- Low-grade fever, blood/urine cultures negative, abx discontinued HD#4

### 7. Nutrition/Rehabilitation
- Diet advanced as tolerated, PT/OT daily
- Plan: Outpatient cardiac rehab referral

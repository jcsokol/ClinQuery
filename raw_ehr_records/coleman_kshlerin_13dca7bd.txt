## **HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY**

Coleman Kshlerin is an 18-year-old male with past medical history significant for coronary heart disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who initially presented to the ED with acute chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. He was found to have an anterior STEMI and rapidly developed cardiogenic shock refractory to initial medical therapy. He was emergently transferred to the ICU, where he required escalating vasopressor support and was ultimately placed on a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for circulatory support.

He remained in the ICU for a total of 8 days, during which time he was treated with dual antiplatelet therapy, diuretics, and guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure. His course was complicated by transient acute kidney injury, mild transaminitis, and a brief episode of supraventricular tachycardia. The temporary heart pump was weaned and explanted on hospital day 6 after improvement in cardiac function as assessed by serial echocardiograms and hemodynamics.

He was transitioned to the step-down unit on hospital day 7 and was discharged home on day 11 with close cardiology follow-up.

## **PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock s/p STEMI, Temporary LVAD (Impella CP)**
- **Summary:** Developed cardiogenic shock 2 hours after presentation, with hypotension and rising lactate. Initiated on norepinephrine, dobutamine, then Impella CP.
- **Course:** Improved over 5 days, LVAD explanted day 6.
- **Plan:** Continue guideline-directed therapy, cardiac rehab referral, close follow-up with advanced heart failure. Monitor for ventricular arrhythmias, optimize meds (GDMT). Continue low-dose diuretic for mild residual congestion.

### 2. **Acute Kidney Injury (prerenal, multifactorial)**
- **Peak Creatinine:** 2.1 mg/dL, baseline 0.9.
- **Course:** Improved with restoration of perfusion, IVF, diuresis post-shock.
- **Plan:** Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, continue to monitor UOP.

### 3. **Coronary Artery Disease, s/p PCI to LAD**
- **Stents:** DES to proximal and mid-LAD placed on admission.
- **Plan:** Continue DAPT (aspirin + clopidogrel x12mo), statin, beta-blocker, ACEi if tolerated.

### 4. **Acute Heart Failure (reduced EF, initial 22%, recovered to 38%)**
- **Plan:** Continue low sodium diet, daily weights, furosemide PRN, titrate guideline-directed meds.

### 5. **Transient Transaminitis**
- **Peak AST/ALT:** 132/105 U/L, resolved with improved perfusion.
- **Plan:** Monitor LFTs, avoid hepatotoxic drugs.

### 6. **SVT Episode**
- **Onset:** Day 3, resolved with adenosine.
- **Plan:** Monitor telemetry, no recurrence.

### 7. **Other PMHx (remote)**
- **Sprain of ankle/wrist, clavicle fracture, viral sinusitis, acute bronchitis:** No acute issues. Supportive care as needed.

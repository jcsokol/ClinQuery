## Chief Complaint  
Altered mental status, hypotension, acute respiratory distress

## HPI  
Nicolasa Reynolds is a 96-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's disease, fibromyalgia, prediabetes, and prior first-trimester miscarriage, who presented from her memory care facility after being found unresponsive with labored breathing and a reported syncopal episode. On arrival, she was hypotensive (SBP 78 mmHg), tachycardic, hypoxic on room air, and had a GCS of 9 (E2V2M5). She was intubated in the ED for airway protection and transferred to the MICU.

Initial workup showed evidence of acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock, lactic acidosis, and AKI. Echo revealed severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF ~20%) with global hypokinesis. Inotropes were started. Due to persistent shock refractory to vasopressors, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 1. She is now day 4 post-Impella placement. 

She has required ongoing hemodynamic monitoring and support. Hospital course complicated by delirium, mild transaminitis, and a right thigh skin laceration from a fall.

## Imaging/Studies

- **Echocardiogram (3/13/24):** Severe global LV systolic dysfunction (EF 20%), moderate MR, mild TR, RV function normal, no LV thrombus, IVC dilated and non-collapsing.
- **CXR (3/13/24):** Pulmonary edema, bilateral patchy infiltrates, enlarged cardiac silhouette.
- **Head CT (3/13/24):** No acute intracranial process, chronic cerebral atrophy.
- **Lower extremity exam:** Right thigh laceration, 2cm, superficial, no signs of infection.

---

## Assessment & Plan

**1. Cardiogenic shock s/p Impella CP (day 4):**  
- Likely on background of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy (new diagnosis).
- Now on low-dose dobutamine, Impella CP at P4, MAPs stable 65–70 mmHg, weaning vasopressors.
- Plan: Continue hemodynamic monitoring, titrate inotropes/Impella, daily echo, monitor for LV recovery, consider weaning Impella if able.  
- Monitor for hemolysis, vascular complications, device thrombosis.  
- Cardiology, CT surgery on board.

**2. Acute decompensated heart failure:**  
- Diuresed with IV furosemide, now net negative ~2L.  
- Strict I/Os, daily weights, adjust diuretics as tolerated.  
- Continue guideline-directed medical therapy as able.

**3. Acute kidney injury (prerenal, resolving):**  
- Initial Cr up to 1.7, now improved to 1.0.  
- Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust meds for renal dosing.

**4. Respiratory failure, intubated:**  
- On pressure support, FiO2 weaning, spontaneous breathing trial planned.  
- Daily CXR, pulmonary toilet, DVT prophylaxis.

**5. Severe Alzheimer’s dementia:**  
- Baseline MMSE 3/30, nonverbal, dependent for all ADLs.  
- Family updated, DPOA aware of current status.  
- Galantamine/memantine on hold per NPO status.

**6. Delirium:**  
- Likely multifactorial: critical illness, infection, ICU environment.  
- Non-pharmacologic interventions, minimize sedation.

**7. Right thigh laceration:**  
- Superficial, cleaned and dressed, no signs of cellulitis.  
- Plastics consulted, will monitor for infection.

**8. Transaminitis:**  
- Mild, likely ischemic.  
- Monitor LFTs, avoid hepatotoxic meds.

**9. Prediabetes:**  
- Glucose control, sliding scale insulin as needed.

**10. Chronic pain/fibromyalgia:**  
- Home milnacipran, naproxen held in ICU, pain controlled, no acute issues.

**11. Hyperlipidemia:**  
- Atorvastatin held due to LFT elevation, re-evaluate when LFTs normalize.

**12. Osteoarthritis:**  
- No acute flare.

**13. Advanced age, poor baseline functional status:**  
- Poor prognosis discussed with family, goals of care revisited daily.

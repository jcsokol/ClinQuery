### **H&P / ICU Course**

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and orthopnea x 1 week. Brought in by family after syncopal episode at home.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Cliff Considine is a 110-year-old male (remarkable longevity; likely a data error but proceeding per template) with a history of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ~45%), diabetes mellitus, CKD stage 1, prostate cancer (s/p leuprolide, docetaxel), and osteoporosis, who presented with acute decompensated heart failure. The patient experienced a syncopal event at home, associated with worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and 3+ pitting edema. He was found to be hypotensive and tachycardic in the ED, requiring ICU admission for escalating pressor support and eventual placement of a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) due to cardiogenic shock.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension  
- Diabetes mellitus (on insulin)  
- Prediabetes  
- Hypertriglyceridemia  
- Metabolic syndrome  
- CKD stage 1  
- Diabetic renal disease  
- Prostate neoplasm (s/p leuprolide, docetaxel)  
- Osteoporosis (on alendronate)  
- CHF, chronic  
- Recent ankle sprain  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- TURP (year unknown)  
- Left hip ORIF (remote)  

**Social History:**  
- Lives with daughter  
- Former smoker, quit 1970s  
- No EtOH, no illicit drugs  
- Ambulates with walker  

**Family History:**  
- Father: MI at 62  
- Mother: T2DM, osteoporosis  

**Home Medications:**  
- Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg daily  
- Metoprolol succinate 100mg daily  
- Lasix 40mg daily  
- Insulin (NPH/Regular)  
- Acetaminophen 325mg prn

### **Problem-Based Assessment and Plan**

#### 1. **Acute Decompensated CHF w/ Cardiogenic Shock [Impella placed]**
   - Impella CP placed day 1 for refractory shock, removed day 6 after hemodynamic recovery.
   - IV Lasix, strict I&O, daily weights, slow diuresis.
   - Continue GDMT (metoprolol, lasix).
   - Monitor for arrhythmia, renal function, volume status.

#### 2. **AKI on CKD**
   - Likely multifactorial: cardiorenal, diuretic effect, possible contrast.
   - Renal function improving, monitor BMP daily.
   - Hold nephrotoxics, continue furosemide for volume.

#### 3. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus / Glucose Lability**
   - Insulin titrated per sliding scale.
   - Monitor for hypoglycemia, especially with improved renal function.

#### 4. **Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia**
   - Empiric abx (ceftriaxone/azithro), de-escalate based on cultures.
   - CXR and clinical monitoring.

#### 5. **Chronic Prostate Cancer**
   - Stable, oncology following.
   - Continue leuprolide, docetaxel as tolerated.

#### 6. **Osteoporosis**
   - Continue alendronate.
   - PT/OT for fall prevention, avoid excess sedation.

#### 7. **Arrhythmia (A-fib, transient)**
   - Rate controlled with metoprolol.
   - No further episodes since day 3.

#### 8. **Deconditioning**
   - PT/OT daily.
   - Plan for SNF placement.

#### 9. **Secondary Prevention**
   - Continue statin, anti-HTN, DM control.
   - Education for CHF, diabetes.

### **Discharge Planning**
- Discharge to SNF when medically stable.
- Arrange outpatient follow-up: Cardiology, Nephrology, Oncology, Endocrinology, PT/OT.
- Home meds to be reconciled prior to discharge.

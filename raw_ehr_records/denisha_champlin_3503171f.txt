EpicCare Inpatient
Patient: Denisha Champlin    MRN: 10593241    DOB: 11/29/1946    Sex: F
Admit Date: 03/22/2024       Attending: Dr. K. Riverton, MD      Location: CVICU

Admission Diagnosis:
- Cardiogenic shock secondary to acute decompensated heart failure
- History of coronary artery disease, prior MI
- Recent NSTEMI
- Chronic sinusitis

Hospital Course Summary:
Ms. Champlin is a 77-year-old female with a history significant for coronary artery disease, prior MI, multiple pregnancies, chronic sinusitis, and hypertension, who presented to the ED with acute-onset chest pain, dyspnea, and fatigue. She was found to have an NSTEMI on initial workup with evidence of pulmonary edema and hypotension. Despite IV diuresis and vasopressor support, she remained hypotensive and oliguric. Given refractory cardiogenic shock, she was transferred to the CVICU and underwent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

She was managed with dual antiplatelet therapy, heparin drip, IV diuretics, and ventilatory support. Over the course of 7 days, her hemodynamics stabilized, and the device was weaned and removed on hospital day 6. She was transitioned to guideline-directed HF therapy and discharged in stable condition on day 12.

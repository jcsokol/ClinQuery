## HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Ms. Greta Schowalter is a 51-year-old female with a PMHx significant for obesity, multiple prior contraceptive therapies, h/o forearm fracture, and recent viral sinusitis, who presented to the ED with progressive SOB, orthopnea, and a syncopal episode at home. Initial workup revealed elevated troponins, EKG with diffuse T wave inversions, and echo with EF 15% with global hypokinesis. She rapidly developed cardiogenic shock requiring pressor and inotrope support. Given refractory shock, she was transferred to the CVICU and an Impella CP (temporary LVAD) was placed for hemodynamic support. Extensive workup suggested viral myocarditis as the etiology, presumably secondary to recent viral URI. Her course was complicated by acute kidney injury, mild transaminitis, and delirium. She was successfully weaned off the Impella on HD #5 and transitioned to guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure. She is currently on telemetry, euvolemic, and preparing for discharge to acute rehab.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

1. **Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Viral Myocarditis**
   - Impella CP placed for circulatory support, removed HD #5 after clinical improvement
   - IV inotropes, weaned as tolerated
   - Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF initiated
   - Serial Echos, trending biomarkers
   - Monitor for arrhythmias, volume status

2. **Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, multifactorial)**
   - Likely secondary to low cardiac output and nephrotoxic meds
   - Monitored urine output, daily BMPs
   - Renal function improved with hemodynamic stabilization
   - Avoid NSAIDs and nephrotoxic agents

3. **Obesity (BMI 30)**
   - Dietician consult, calorie-controlled diet
   - Daily weights

4. **Transaminitis**
   - Likely ischemic hepatitis due to shock liver
   - LFTs trended, now normalizing
   - No evidence of viral or obstructive etiology

5. **Delirium**
   - Multifactorial: ICU stay, metabolic derangements
   - Non-pharm measures, reorientation, sleep hygiene

6. **History of Drug Overdose**
   - No acute toxicity, remote history
   - Psychiatry consulted for assessment

7. **Viral Sinusitis**
   - Resolved, no current symptoms

8. **Contraceptive Management**
   - All hormonal contraceptives discontinued
   - Counseling for future options given HF diagnosis

9. **Mobility/Deconditioning**
   - PT/OT, early mobilization

10. **Discharge Planning**
    - To acute rehab, close cardiology and nephrology follow-up
    - LifeVest considered, pending further EF improvement

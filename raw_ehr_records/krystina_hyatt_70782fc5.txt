### Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, chest pain, and syncope.

---

### HPI:
Krystina Hyatt is a 49-year-old female with a history of hypertension, perennial allergic rhinitis, and multiple prior upper respiratory infections, who presented to the ED with acute onset chest pain, dyspnea, and one episode of syncope at home. She was found to be hypotensive (SBP in the 70s) and tachycardic (HR 130s) on arrival. No prior cardiac history, but notable for poorly controlled HTN and recent viral illness. On exam, JVD and bibasilar crackles were noted, O2 sat 88% on RA, and ECG revealed diffuse ST depression. She rapidly deteriorated into cardiogenic shock requiring pressors and was transferred to the ICU, where she subsequently required placement of a temporary left-sided percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for circulatory support.  

---

### Hospital Course Summary:
- **Day 0:** Admitted to ICU in cardiogenic shock. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine. Emergent cardiac cath: non-obstructive CAD, EF 15%. Labs notable for elevated troponin, BNP. Temporary LVAD placed for refractory shock.
- **Day 1-2:** Gradual improvement in perfusion, weaned from pressors. Developed AKI (Cr peaked at 2.1).  
- **Day 3:** VSS, started on gentle diuresis. LVAD flows stable.  
- **Day 4:** LVAD weaned and removed. Echo: EF improved to 32%.  
- **Day 5:** Transferred out of ICU to stepdown, stable on oral meds.  
- **Complications:** AKI (resolved), anemia (transfused 1U PRBC), mild transaminitis, transient delirium.

---

## Physical Exam (2024-06-02):

- **Gen:** Alert, NAD, conversational.
- **CV:** Tachycardic, S3, no murmurs, LVAD hum present.
- **Lungs:** Bibasilar crackles, mild rales, improved from prior.
- **Abd:** Soft, NT, mild RUQ tenderness.
- **Ext:** No edema, pulses 2+.
- **Neuro:** AOx3, no focal deficits.

## Assessment & Plan

### 1. Cardiogenic shock, likely viral myocarditis vs. stress-induced (Takotsubo)
- Required temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for circulatory support, now explanted.
- EF improved from 15% → 32% by Day 4.
- Plan: Continue goal-directed medical therapy (GDMT), monitor for arrhythmias, serial echoes, telemetry.
- Cardiology f/u. Will consider cardiac MRI as outpatient.

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (stage 2, multifactorial: hypoperfusion, nephrotoxins)
- Cr peaked at 2.1, now trending down to 1.3.
- Avoid nephrotoxins, monitor UOP, renal panel q12h.
- Nephrology consulted.

### 3. Anemia (Hgb nadir 7.9, baseline ~13)
- Suspect dilutional + phlebotomy-related; 1U PRBC transfused.
- Monitor CBC, iron studies pending.

### 4. Transaminitis
- AST/ALT peaked at 142/167, now trending down.
- Likely ischemic hepatitis secondary to shock.
- Monitor LFTs.

### 5. Hypertension
- Home regimen resumed (amlodipine/HCTZ/olmesartan).
- BP stable, goal <130/80.

### 6. Allergic rhinitis, remote viral URI
- No acute issues during admission.
- Continue home meds PRN.

### 7. Contraceptive management
- On etonogestrel implant, errin, Jolivette, NuvaRing (complex history, currently on implant).
- No acute GYN issues.

### 8. Psychosocial/disposition
- Social work involved for support, education about LVAD/heart failure.
- Discharge planning underway.

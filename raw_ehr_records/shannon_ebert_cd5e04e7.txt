### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and hypotension after extensive burns.

---

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Shannon Ebert is a 34-year-old male with a history of obesity (BMI 38), chronic sinusitis, and recent third-degree burns (20% TBSA, chest and upper extremities) sustained in a house fire 9 days ago. He was initially managed at an outside facility with wound debridement and empiric antibiotics (cefuroxime), but developed worsening shortness of breath, hypotension, and signs of low cardiac output. He was transferred to our ICU for escalating vasopressor requirements and hypoxemia.

On admission, he was tachycardic (HR 122), hypotensive (MAP 59 mmHg despite norepinephrine), with cool extremities, JVD, and bibasilar crackles. Labs showed rising lactate, acute kidney injury, and elevated troponin. Echo revealed severe global LV dysfunction (EF 15%), RV mildly reduced, no tamponade. Swan-Ganz placed: CI 1.6, wedge 26 mmHg, SVR 1200. Cardiology recommended placement of a percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock. Device successfully placed on HD2.

## ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Acute Heart Failure**
   - Etiology: Burn stress, possible viral myocarditis, no clear CAD.
   - Management: Impella CP for temporary LV support, diuresis, guideline-directed therapy (ACEi held for AKI), telemetry, daily echo.
   - Plan: Continue hemodynamic monitoring, titrate diuretics, optimize volume status, consider cardiac MRI as outpatient.

### 2. **Third Degree Burns (20% TBSA)**
   - Debrided at OSH, ongoing wound care, daily dressing changes, monitor for infection.
   - Burn surgery following; nutrition support, PT/OT.

### 3. **Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, improved)**
   - Likely secondary to low-output state, now resolving.
   - Monitor UOP, avoid nephrotoxins, trending down Cr.

### 4. **Obesity (BMI 38)**
   - High risk for complications, pressure ulcer prevention, DVT prophylaxis.

### 5. **Chronic Sinusitis**
   - No acute symptoms, continue outpatient management.

### 6. **Pain/Analgesia**
   - Meperidine and acetaminophen PRN, pain controlled.

### 7. **Infection risk**
   - On cefuroxime, monitor for fever/bacteremia, daily blood cultures x2 negative.

### 8. **Anticoagulation**
   - Heparin infusion while Impella in place, transitioned to SQ heparin post-explant.

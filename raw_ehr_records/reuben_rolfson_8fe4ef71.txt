# History of Present Illness

47-year-old male with PMH significant for obesity (BMI 30+), CAD, prior MI (2019), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent viral sinusitis, presenting to ED with acute-onset substernal chest pain radiating to left arm, diaphoresis, and dyspnea. Initial ECG showed ST elevations in anterior leads. Emergent cath revealed 100% proximal LAD occlusion; PCI performed with DES placement. Hospital course complicated by hypotension refractory to fluids and vasopressors, requiring temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placement for cardiogenic shock. Transferred to CVICU.

---

# Hospital Course Summary

- **Day 1:** Presented with STEMI, underwent emergent PCI to LAD. Developed hypotension, lactate 6.2, echo with EF 18%. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine. Impella CP placed for mechanical circulatory support. Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
- **Day 2:** Weaned off norepinephrine. Improving lactate. Remains on Impella, EF 22%. Mild transaminitis.  
- **Day 3:** Extubated. Impella flows weaned overnight. Started on low-dose captopril, uptitrated statin.  
- **Day 4:** Impella removed. Echo EF 30%. Transferred to step-down unit.  
- **Day 5:** Ambulating with PT. Discharged to home on GDMT.

# Problem List & Assessment/Plan

## 1. Cardiogenic Shock s/p STEMI (LAD)
- **Assessment:** Acute anterior STEMI with profound LV dysfunction and cardiogenic shock, required Impella CP for 72 hours. Hemodynamics stabilized, EF improved to 30%.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor for arrhythmias, volume status.
  - Continue GDMT (captopril, beta-blocker, statin, DAPT).
  - Follow-up with outpatient HF clinic in 1 week.
  - Consider ICD if EF remains <35% at 90 days.

## 2. Coronary Artery Disease / s/p PCI
- **Assessment:** CAD with prior MI, multiple risk factors. DES placed to proximal LAD.  
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue DAPT (clopidogrel, ASA), statin, ACEi, BB.
  - Lifestyle counseling for weight loss, exercise.
  - Cardiac rehab referral.

## 3. Obesity (BMI 30+)
- **Assessment:** BMI 30.1 at admission. Obesity is a major CV risk factor.
- **Plan:**  
  - Nutrition consult.
  - Weight reduction goals.
  - Monitor for OSA symptoms.

## 4. Hypertension
- **Assessment:** Long-standing, suboptimally controlled.
- **Plan:**  
  - Resume amlodipine, titrate as tolerated.
  - Monitor BP, adjust meds as needed.

## 5. Hyperlipidemia
- **Assessment:** On statins, LDL at goal.
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue atorvastatin 80 mg.
  - Lipid panel in 6 weeks.

## 6. Recent Viral Sinusitis
- **Assessment:** Symptoms resolved, no evidence of ongoing infection.
- **Plan:**  
  - Supportive care. Monitor for recurrence.

## 7. Laceration of Forearm (resolved)
- **Assessment:** Sutured in ED, no signs of infection.
- **Plan:**  
  - Remove sutures in 7 days. Monitor wound.

## 8. Pain
- **Assessment:** Mild-moderate post-procedural pain, NRS 3-4/10.
- **Plan:**  
  - PRN acetaminophen.
  - Avoid NSAIDs.

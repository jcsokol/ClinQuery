### Chief Complaint  
Acute onset chest pain, dyspnea, and progressive lower extremity edema.  

---

### HPI  
46-year-old male with PMHx notable for chronic sinusitis, recurrent viral and strep pharyngitis, obesity (BMI 27), and remote right ankle sprain, presenting with 3 days of worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and new lower extremity swelling. Denies fevers/chills but reports decreased exercise tolerance. On day of admission, developed acute chest pressure and lightheadedness, prompting ED visit.

## Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

### 1. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure / Cardiogenic Shock (likely viral myocarditis)
- Presenting with acute HF and shock; required temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP) on Day 1.
- Now stable, Impella weaning protocol initiated.
- Monitoring for arrhythmias, hemolysis, infection.
- HF regimen titration ongoing.
- Continue daily weights, I/O, fluid restriction.
- Cardiology to follow for advanced HF therapies if needed.

### 2. Impella Device (Temporary LVAD)
- Inserted on hospital day 1 for refractory shock.
- No evidence of device-related complications (hemolysis, limb ischemia, infection).
- Labs: Monitor LDH, haptoglobin, CBC, Cr daily.
- Plan for explant on Day 8 if clinical stability maintained.

### 3. Acute Kidney Injury (resolved)
- Initial rise in Cr, now improved with improved perfusion and diuresis.
- Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins.

### 4. Transaminitis (congestive hepatopathy)
- LFTs uptrending, now improving with volume removal.
- Continue to trend AST/ALT.

### 5. Fever/Leukocytosis (rule out infection)
- Empiric antibiotics started, discontinued after cultures negative and clinical improvement.
- Monitor for secondary infection, esp. device-related.

### 6. Hypotension/Shock
- Initially required vasopressors/inotropes, now off.
- Monitor for recurrence.

### 7. Chronic Sinusitis
- No acute exacerbation during admission.
- Home meds held; outpatient follow-up.

### 8. DVT Prophylaxis
- Enoxaparin while immobile.
- Continue until ambulating independently.

### 9. Nutrition
- Initially NPO, now cardiac diet.
- Monitor for refeeding.

### 10. PT/OT Needs
- Bedrest initially, now mobilizing with assistance.
- Continue to work with therapies.

### 11. Psychosocial
- Patient anxious re: prognosis; SW and chaplain involved.

---

### Disposition
- Anticipate transfer to stepdown once Impella explanted and stable on oral regimen.
- Close outpatient cardiology follow-up required.

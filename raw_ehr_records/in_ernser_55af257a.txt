ASSESSMENT & PLAN (ICU Day 5):

**1. Cardiogenic shock, acute decompensated HF, s/p Impella CP:**
- Etiology likely ischemic (possible silent MI) with severe LV dysfunction.
- Now hemodynamically stable, off Impella, EF remains low.
- Continue guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): beta-blocker, ACE-i/ARB (as tolerated), cautious diuresis.
- Repeat echo prior to discharge.
- Cardiac rehab referral.

**2. Acute kidney injury (AKI):**
- Pre-renal, multifactorial (low flow, diuretics).
- Renal function improving with euvolemia.
- Monitor daily labs, strict I/Os.

**3. New-onset atrial fibrillation:**
- Converted to NSR with amio; plan for PO amio x 1 week, then re-eval.
- Anticoagulation deferred due to high bleeding risk, recent Impella.

**4. Volume overload / Pulmonary edema:**
- Now net negative, euvolemic.
- Slow uptitration of oral diuretics.

**5. Fever, possible line infection:**
- Blood cultures negative, empiric abx discontinued.
- Remove invasive lines as soon as feasible.

**6. Chronic sinusitis:**
- Symptomatic management; ENT outpatient follow-up.

**7. Colon polyp hx:**
- Surveillance colonoscopy per GI.

**8. Anemia of chronic disease:**
- Monitor Hgb, iron studies, continue iron PO.

**9. Delirium:**
- Resolved; maintain non-pharmacologic measures.

**10. Disposition:**
- Anticipate transfer to telemetry, then home with family support.
- Goals of care discussed with patient and daughter, DNR/DNI not indicated at this time.

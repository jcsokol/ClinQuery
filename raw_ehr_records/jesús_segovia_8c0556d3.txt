### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Acute dyspnea, chest pain, and confusion

---

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

Mr. Segovia is a 111-year-old male with extensive PMHx including obesity, HTN, pre-DM, chronic anemia, COPD, HLD, prior CVA, advanced Alzheimer’s, osteoporosis with prior pathologic fractures, and recent pneumonia, who presented from SNF with progressive dyspnea, confusion, and hypoxia.

On arrival, he was found to be hypoxic (O2 sat 84% RA), tachypneic, and hypertensive (BP 172/94). Initial CXR showed bibasilar infiltrates, concern for CHF exacerbation vs. pneumonia. Troponin I was 0.14 (mildly elevated), BNP 1620, EKG: NSR with poor R wave progression. Echo: LVEF 18%, global hypokinesis, moderate MR.

He developed acute cardiogenic shock on HD2 (MAP <60, lactic acid 5.3, cool extremities, worsening AKI). Required dobutamine and norepinephrine, but remained hypotensive. Temporary left-sided Impella CP device placed for hemodynamic support. Gradual improvement over 72 hrs, weaned off pressors, device removed HD5.

Hospital course complicated by delirium, persistent anemia, and worsening kidney function. Treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (cefepime/vanc), received 2u PRBC for Hgb 7.4. Orthopedic consult for left clavicle pain—old, non-displaced pathologic fx, no acute intervention.

Currently, mentation improved from baseline, off pressors, on 2L NC O2, ambulating with PT. Awaiting SNF placement.

## PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock/Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure
- Decompensated HFrEF (EF 18%), acute shock requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP)
- Etiology: Likely ischemic + hypertensive heart disease, prior CVA
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue GDMT as tolerated (HCTZ held, beta-blocker not initiated due to hypotension)
  - Monitor for arrhythmias, volume status
  - Daily weights, strict I/Os
  - Cardiology to follow
  - Impella removed HD5, maintain hemodynamics, consider advanced therapies only if further decompensation

### 2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, multifactorial
- CHF exacerbation, hospital-acquired pneumonia, underlying COPD
- **Plan:**  
  - O2 via NC (goal >92%), wean as tolerated
  - Continue Advair
  - Cefepime/vanc x7d (started HD2)
  - Chest PT, incentive spirometry

### 3. Anemia, chronic with acute drop
- Baseline Hgb ~12, nadir 7.4 (HD4), transfused 2u PRBC
- Likely multifactorial: CKD, chronic disease, possible GI loss (occult blood neg)
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor CBC daily
  - Iron studies, B12/folate pending
  - Transfuse for Hgb <8.0

### 4. Acute Kidney Injury on CKD
- Cr up to 2.10, improved to 1.08 prior to d/c from ICU
- Likely pre-renal from low output, improved with support
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor renal function, adjust meds
  - Avoid nephrotoxins, IV fluids as needed

### 5. Delirium/Advanced Dementia
- Severe Alzheimer’s, worsened by acute illness, now improved
- **Plan:**  
  - Reorient, minimize restraints, avoid sedatives
  - PT/OT consult

### 6. Osteoporosis/Old Pathologic Fractures
- Old fx L clavicle, L forearm; T-score -3.1
- **Plan:**  
  - Maintain Ca/Vit D, fall precautions
  - No acute ortho intervention

### 7. Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Prediabetes
- **Plan:**  
  - Resume statin, HCTZ when stable
  - Monitor BP, lipids, glucose

### 8. Pain (chronic, mild)
- **Plan:**  
  - Tylenol PRN, avoid NSAIDs due to AKI

---

## DISPOSITION

- **Transitioning to SNF**
- Goals of care: DNR, comfort-focused with re-eval for future cardiac interventions if acute decompensation

Patient Name: Amalia Magaña           MRN: 00291824
DOB: 02/23/2007   Sex: Female         Age: 17 years
Admit Date: 04/21/2024                Attending: Dr. R. Sandhu
Encounter: ICU Admission
--------------------------------------------------------------

Reason for Admission:
Acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock requiring temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) placement.

HPI:
Amalia Magaña is a 17-year-old female with a history of atopic dermatitis, childhood asthma, and recent viral sinusitis who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, and chest discomfort. She was previously well, but developed a viral URI 10 days prior. Symptoms progressed to severe fatigue, poor oral intake, and syncopal episode at home prompting EMS activation. In the ED, she was noted to be tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic. Initial evaluation revealed evidence of low cardiac output and end-organ hypoperfusion. She was admitted to the PICU and quickly required escalation to inotropic support and subsequently temporary left-sided heart pump (Impella) placement for refractory cardiogenic shock.

PMHx:
- Atopic dermatitis
- Childhood asthma
- Recurrent otitis media
- Viral sinusitis (recent)
- No prior cardiac history
- No known congenital heart disease

PSHx:
- None

Allergies:
- NKDA

Home Medications:
- Fexofenadine 30 mg PO daily
- Fluticasone HFA 44 mcg 2 puffs BID
- Albuterol HFA 90 mcg 2 puffs PRN
- Epinephrine autoinjector (carries but never used)
- Acetaminophen 160 mg PO PRN
- Amoxicillin 250 mg PO TID (recent, completed for sinusitis)
- Ibuprofen 100 mg PO PRN

Family/Social History:
- Lives with mother and younger brother. No tobacco/alcohol/drug use. No family history of cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death. Up to date on immunizations.

Physical Exam (on admission):
- Gen: Appears ill, pale, diaphoretic
- VS: BP 78/42, HR 146, RR 28, SpO2 93% RA, T 37.2°C
- HEENT: Mild periorbital edema, injected conjunctivae
- CV: Tachycardic, S3 gallop, no murmurs, cool extremities, delayed cap refill
- Resp: Tachypneic, mild intercostal retractions, scattered crackles
- Abd: Soft, mildly distended, non-tender, hepatomegaly
- Skin: Eczematous patches on flexural surfaces
- Neuro: Lethargic but arousable, no focal deficits

--------------------- PROGRESS NOTES --------------------------

ICU Day 1-4:

She was stabilized on BiPAP and milrinone, but remained hypotensive with rising lactate and worsening renal function. Echocardiogram: LVEF <15%, globally hypokinetic, mild MR, no pericardial effusion. Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated (see labs). Decision made for Impella CP placement via femoral approach for circulatory support. Post-procedure: improved perfusion, normalization of lactate, urine output improved.

Developed transient hemolysis (LDH ↑, haptoglobin ↓), managed with pump speed adjustment, hydration. No significant arrhythmias. Extubated on ICU day 3. Weaned off inotropes and Impella explanted on ICU day 5.

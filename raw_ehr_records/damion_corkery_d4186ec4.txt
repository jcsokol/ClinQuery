### ADMISSION NOTE

**Chief Complaint:**  
Shortness of breath, chest pain, and near-syncope at home.

**History of Present Illness:**  
54-year-old obese male with history of chronic sinusitis, first-degree burn (remote, resolved), and obesity (BMI 30.2) presented via EMS after acute, severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, diaphoresis, and SOB. At home, he collapsed briefly; wife reports 30 seconds of unresponsiveness, no seizure activity. EMS noted hypotension (SBP 78 mmHg), O2 sat 88% on RA, HR 132, and administered O2, aspirin. In ED, he was found to be in cardiogenic shock, with worsening hypoxia and hypotension despite fluids and vasopressors. Emergent echo showed LVEF ~10% with global hypokinesis, no tamponade. Cardiology consulted, urgent LHC revealed severe triple vessel disease, no acute culprit. Temporary left-sided Impella CP device placed for circulatory support.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Chronic sinusitis  
- Obesity (BMI >30)  
- Remote first-degree burn (resolved)  

**Past Surgical History:**  
- None  

**Medications on Admission:**  
- Naproxen sodium 220mg PO PRN  
- No home cardiac meds  

**Allergies:**  
- NKDA  

**Family History:**  
- Father: MI at 67  
- Mother: HTN, DM2  

**Social History:**  
- Former smoker, 20 pack-years, quit 2018  
- Occasional EtOH  
- Lives with wife, retired accountant  

**Review of Systems:**  
Unable to obtain complete ROS due to clinical status.

### HOSPITAL COURSE (ICU)

**Day 1:**

- Started on broad spectrum abx (Vanc/Zosyn) pending cultures.  

**Day 2:**  
- Remains on Impella support.  
- Lactate downtrending from 6.2 → 2.8 mmol/L.  
- Weaning vasopressors.  
- Renal function: Oliguric, Cr up to 2.0 mg/dL (baseline 1.1).  
- Cardiac enzymes: Downtrending troponin.  
- CXR: Pulmonary edema improved.  
- Blisters noted on left heel (pressure injury), wound care consulted.  

**Day 3:**  
- Off vasopressors, extubated to high-flow nasal cannula.  
- Impella wean trial started.  
- Renal function improved; urine output >0.5 mL/kg/hr.  
- Mental status: Awake, following commands.  
- Nutrition: Enteral feeds started.  

**Day 4:**  
- Impella successfully explanted, hemodynamics stable.  
- Diuresed aggressively for residual pulmonary edema.  
- Echo: LVEF improved to 25%.  
- Plan for staged CABG as outpatient.  
- Mobilizing with PT/OT.

### PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

#### 1. Cardiogenic Shock, Severe LV Dysfunction (LVEF 10% → 25%)
- Etiology: Ischemic, severe triple vessel CAD.
- Required emergent Impella CP for hemodynamic support.
- Now off Impella, hemodynamically stable.
- Plan: Aggressive diuresis, afterload reduction, optimize for staged CABG. Continue GDMT as tolerated.

#### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (Stage 2, likely pre-renal)
- Oliguria, Cr peaked at 2.0, now improving.
- Plan: Continue fluid balance, monitor labs, avoid nephrotoxins, consult nephrology if worsening.

#### 3. Respiratory Failure, S/P Intubation
- Extubated on ICU day 3; now on HFNC.
- Plan: Pulm toilet, incentive spirometry, monitor for reintubation.

#### 4. Obesity (BMI 30.2)
- Risk factor for CAD, wound healing.
- Plan: Nutrition consult, daily weights, glycemic control.

#### 5. Pressure Injury, L Heel (Stage I)
- Plan: Wound care, offloading, monitor for progression.

#### 6. Chronic Sinusitis (remote, not active)
- No acute intervention.

#### 7. Hypercholesterolemia
- Plan: Statin therapy to be initiated prior to discharge.

#### 8. Infection Risk
- On empiric abx for possible VAP/bacteremia pending cultures.
- Plan: De-escalate abx if cultures negative.

#### 9. Pain (mild, 1-2/10)
- On PRN naproxen, avoid opioids if possible.

#### 10. Disposition
- Plan for transfer to step-down when stable; home with wife, close f/u with cards, CT surgery.

### HPI

Mr. Brant Ebert is a 53-year-old male with a history of hypertension and remote viral pharyngitis, presenting with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and bilateral leg swelling. He was found hypotensive (BP 80/50) at home, brought in by EMS. On arrival: tachycardic, hypoxic, with pulmonary edema on CXR. Initial labs notable for elevated troponin, BNP. Echo: LVEF 15%, global hypokinesis. He rapidly deteriorated, requiring intubation, vasopressors, and was transferred to the ICU. Due to persistent cardiogenic shock, a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 2.

## Hospital Course

**Day 1 (ED/ICU):**  
Presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension. Intubated for respiratory distress. Started on norepinephrine, dobutamine. Echo: LVEF 15%. Transferred to ICU.

**Day 2:**  
Persistent shock despite inotropes. Cardiology consulted. Temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placed via femoral approach. Hemodynamics improved, vasopressors weaned.

**Day 3:**  
Diuresis initiated. Extubated to high-flow nasal cannula. Renal function stable, mild transaminitis. Started on low-dose beta-blocker, ACEi held for low BP.

**Day 4:**  
LVAD support ongoing. Improved urine output. Mobilized to chair. Plan for LVAD wean trial.

**Day 5:**  
LVAD weaned successfully. Echo: LVEF improved to 30%. Device explanted at bedside. Monitored for arrhythmias, none noted. Transferred to step-down unit.

## Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

### 1. **Cardiogenic Shock, s/p Temporary LVAD**
- s/p Impella CP (femoral) for refractory shock, now explanted
- Hemodynamics improved, off vasopressors/inotropes
- Plan: Continue cardiac monitoring, daily echo for recovery, optimize GDMT (guideline-directed medical therapy), education re: device, consider ICD if persistent low EF

### 2. **Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (LVEF 15% â†’ 30%)**
- Aggressive IV diuresis, fluid restriction, monitor lytes/renal
- Initiated low-dose beta-blocker, uptitrating as tolerated
- Plan: GDMT titration, daily weights, strict I/O, monitor for recurrent congestion

### 3. **Hypertension**
- Home HCTZ held for AKI risk/hypotension
- BP improved with recovery
- Plan: Continue to monitor, resume home regimen as tolerated, consider ACEi uptitration

### 4. **Renal Dysfunction (pre-renal AKI)**
- Mild AKI on admission, improved with volume status optimization
- Plan: Monitor Cr/BUN daily, avoid nephrotoxins, maintain MAP > 65

### 5. **Transaminitis**
- Mild, likely ischemic hepatitis from shock liver, improved
- Plan: Trending down, monitor LFTs, avoid hepatotoxins

### 6. **Hyperlipidemia**
- Not on statin at baseline, started atorvastatin
- Plan: Continue, outpatient lipid clinic f/u

### 7. **Prophylaxis (VTE, GI)**
- Heparin IV for Impella, transitioned to SQ heparin when device off
- Pantoprazole for GI protection

### 8. **Other**
- Physical therapy: Mobilizing with assistance
- Nutrition: Cardiac diet, Na restriction
- Social work: Assess for home supports, post-discharge care

---

## Discharge Planning

- Anticipate discharge to home in 1-2 days if stable
- Cardiology f/u in 1 week, echo in 1 month
- Home meds: continue beta-blocker, ACEi, statin, aspirin, diuretic as tolerated
- Heart failure education

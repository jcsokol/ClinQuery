### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Irma Crona is a 45-year-old female with a history of hypertension (on HCTZ), remote first trimester miscarriage, and recent viral URIs, who presented with 1 week of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. She reported a viral illness with cough and sinus congestion 2 weeks prior, followed by increasing fatigue and mild chest discomfort. On the day of admission, the patient developed acute onset shortness of breath and near-syncope while climbing stairs. She was brought in by EMS, found to be hypotensive (BP 78/52), tachycardic (HR 124), and hypoxic (SpO2 88% RA), with signs of pulmonary edema.

Initial workup revealed elevated cardiac biomarkers, acute kidney injury, elevated lactate, and CXR with pulmonary vascular congestion. Bedside echo demonstrated severely reduced LVEF (~15%), global hypokinesis, and no significant valvulopathy. She was admitted to the ICU for cardiogenic shock, started on inotropes and mechanical ventilation. Due to persistent shock refractory to medical management, a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was placed on hospital day 1.

### HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY

**ICU Day 1-2:**  
- Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure; started norepinephrine and dobutamine drips.  
- Impella CP placed via right femoral approach.  
- CVP 16, MAP 62 on moderate pressors, urine output 0.3 mL/kg/hr.  
- Started empiric broad spectrum abx (cefepime/vancomycin) for possible sepsis.  
- Echo confirmed severe global LV dysfunction, RV mildly reduced.  
- Consults: Cardiology, CV Surgery, Nephro (for AKI/oliguria).  
- Initial labs: WBC 12.3, Cr 2.1 (baseline 0.9), lactate 4.8.

**ICU Day 3-5:**  
- Gradual improvement in perfusion with Impella support, weaned norepinephrine.  
- Extubated on day 4 to HFNC.  
- Diuresed with IV furosemide, net negative 5L over 48h.  
- Renal function slowly improving.  
- Blood cultures negative, abx discontinued.  
- Repeat echo: LVEF improved to 25%, Impella flows stable.  
- Transient LFT elevation (AST/ALT 3x ULN) thought secondary to hypoperfusion.  
- Developed mild thrombocytopenia (nadir 89K) on day 5.

**ICU Day 6-10:**  
- Impella weaned and explanted on day 7.  
- Gradual transition to oral afterload reduction, uptitrated beta-blocker.  
- Mobilization with PT/OT, O2 weaned to nasal cannula.  
- Renal and liver function normalized.  
- Discharge planning with heart failure education.

## ASSESSMENT/PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic shock secondary to acute severe decompensated heart failure (likely viral myocarditis):**  
- Required Impella CP for mechanical circulatory support, now explanted.
- Weaning inotropes/pressors, transitioning to GDMT (BB, ACEi).
- Serial echos to monitor recovery.
- Monitor for arrhythmia, renal/liver dysfunction.
- Cardiac MRI planned outpatient for etiology.

**2. Acute kidney injury (pre-renal, multifactorial):**  
- Initial oliguric AKI, likely from low perfusion.
- Improving with volume removal and improved CO.
- Monitor UOP, daily BMP.
- Avoid nephrotoxins.

**3. Transient hepatic injury:**  
- LFTs peaked on day 2-3, now trending down.
- Supportive care.

**4. Thrombocytopenia:**  
- Down-trending platelets, nadir 89K, likely multifactorial (Impella, sepsis, dilution).
- Monitoring daily, no active bleeding.
- Heme to follow if worsening.

**5. Hypertension (chronic):**  
- Off home HCTZ, will resume when stable.
- Titrate oral antihypertensives prior to discharge.

**6. Deconditioning:**  
- Early PT/OT, nutrition consult.
- Discharge planning with cardiac rehab.

**7. Viral URTI (remote):**  
- No evidence of ongoing infection, abx stopped.

**8. Miscellaneous:**  
- VTE prophylaxis (heparin SQ).
- Stress ulcer prophylaxis (pantoprazole).
- Glycemic control, DVT screening negative.
- Family/caregiver support, SW involved.

### Disposition:  
- Anticipate stepdown to telemetry in 24-48h.
- Follow up with HF clinic, cardiac MRI, repeat echo in 4-6 weeks.

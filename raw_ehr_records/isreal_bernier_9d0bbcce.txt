# Hospital Course (Days 1-7)

**Day 1 (ED/ICU Admit):**  
- Vitals: HR 128, BP 92/54, RR 22, SpO2 95% RA, T 36.8Â°C  
- Exam: Pale, diaphoretic, JVD, S3 gallop, crackles bilaterally, cool extremities, 2+ pitting edema, GCS 15  
- Labs: Significant for elevated troponin, BNP 4200 pg/mL, metabolic acidosis, AKI (Cr 1.7), mild transaminitis  
- ECG: Sinus tachycardia, nonspecific ST changes  
- Echo: Severely reduced LVEF (18%), global hypokinesis, moderate MR, LV dilation  
- CXR: Pulmonary edema  
- Interventions: Fluid resuscitation, IV furosemide, started on milrinone, transferred to MICU

**Day 2:**  
- Worsening hypotension despite escalating inotropes/vasopressors  
- Increasing lactate (6.2), worsening AKI  
- Cardiology/CT surgery consulted  
- Placed on temporary LVAD (Impella CP) for acute decompensated heart failure  
- Started broad spectrum abx (cefepime, vanc) for possible myocarditis  
- Labs: CBC/chem7, LFTs, coags, blood cultures

**Day 3-5:**  
- Remained on Impella, hemodynamics improved  
- Weaned off norepinephrine  
- Extubated on Day 4  
- Serial echos: LVEF improved to 28% by Day 5  
- Renal function improving, urine output normalized  
- Transitioned to low-dose ACEi, spironolactone, carvedilol  
- Infectious workup (-), viral PCR pending  
- Developed mild right groin hematoma at Impella site, monitored

**Day 6-7:**  
- Considered for Impella weaning trial  
- Tolerated reduction in support, stable hemodynamics  
- Repeat echo: LVEF up to 34%  
- Plan to remove Impella on Day 8 if stable  
- PT/OT consulted for deconditioning  
- Nutrition: TPN started, then transitioned to PO as appetite improved

# Problem-Based Assessment & Plan

## 1. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (new onset, probable myocarditis)
- **Assessment:** Severe LV systolic dysfunction, likely viral myocarditis (pending PCR). Required temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP).
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue Impella support, monitor for device complications  
  - Daily TTE, hemodynamic monitoring  
  - Weaning protocol as tolerated  
  - Start guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) as able  
  - Cardiac MRI if stable

## 2. Cardiogenic Shock
- **Assessment:** Multiorgan hypoperfusion, lactic acidosis, AKI, improved with MCS.
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor end-organ function (daily labs, lactate)  
  - Titrate inotropes/vasopressors as needed  
  - Strict I/O, daily weights  
  - Monitor Impella site for bleeding/infection

## 3. AKI (pre-renal, secondary to low output)
- **Assessment:** Creatinine peaked at 2.2, now improving.
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor renal function, adjust nephrotoxic meds  
  - Renal consult prn  
  - Maintain euvolemia

## 4. Malnutrition/Low BMI
- **Assessment:** BMI 15.6; likely chronic, worsened by acute illness.
- **Plan:**  
  - Dietician consult  
  - TPN initially, advancing to PO nutrition  
  - Monitor electrolytes closely

## 5. Sinusitis/Chronic Sinusitis
- **Assessment:** Chronic issue, not contributing to current presentation.
- **Plan:**  
  - Continue supportive care, no acute intervention needed

## 6. Ankle Sprain
- **Assessment:** Minor prior injury.
- **Plan:**  
  - PT/OT for mobility  
  - Ibuprofen PRN pain (hold if renal function worsens)

## 7. Groin Hematoma (Impella site)
- **Assessment:** Mild, stable, no active bleeding.
- **Plan:**  
  - Q4h neurovascular checks  
  - Hold anticoagulation if expansion  
  - Serial Hgb

## 8. Deconditioning/ICU Weakness
- **Assessment:** High risk due to prolonged bedrest.
- **Plan:**  
  - Early mobilization  
  - PT/OT daily

## 9. Transaminitis
- **Assessment:** Mild, likely ischemic hepatitis; trending down.
- **Plan:**  
  - Monitor LFTs  
  - Avoid hepatotoxins

# Summary

This is an 18-year-old male with new acute decompensated heart failure, likely due to viral myocarditis, with severe LV dysfunction requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella).

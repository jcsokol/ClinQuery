### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest discomfort.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Ms. George Kozey is a 45-year-old female with PMH significant for recurrent viral URIs, acute bronchitis, obesity, and dyslipidemia, who presented to the ED with 4 days of worsening shortness of breath, fevers, and cough. She reports orthopnea, PND, and leg swelling. No chest pain but mild chest pressure. She was initially treated for presumed viral bronchitis and sinusitis as an outpatient, but symptoms progressed. In the ED, she was found to be tachypneic and hypoxemic (O2 sat 87% RA). CXR revealed pulmonary edema. Troponin was elevated. BNP 1,940. ECG: Sinus tachycardia, low-voltage QRS. Echo: LVEF 15%, severe global hypokinesis.  

Due to progressive cardiogenic shock refractory to medical therapy, she was emergently transferred to the ICU, where she required a temporary left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for circulatory support. She has not previously had any known cardiac disease.

### CARDIAC IMAGING

**Echocardiogram (6/17/24):**
- LVEF 15%
- Severe global hypokinesis
- Mild LV dilatation
- No valvular vegetations  
- No pericardial effusion

**CXR (6/17/24):**
- Pulmonary edema, mild cardiomegaly

---

### HOSPITAL COURSE (ICU Days 1–4)
- Admitted to ICU for acute decompensated heart failure, likely viral myocarditis (fulminant)
- Developed cardiogenic shock refractory to vasopressors/inotropes; placed on temporary LVAD (Impella CP) on 6/17/24  
- Started on norepinephrine, then weaned off by 6/20/24
- IV diuresis with furosemide, net negative ~3.7L
- Empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone, azithro) for possible superimposed bacterial infection (stopped after 48h, cultures negative)
- Serial troponins and BNP trended down
- Extubated on ICU Day 3
- No arrhythmias, no significant bleeding
- Renal function improved with diuresis
- No evidence of liver failure, transaminitis resolved

---

### PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic Shock, acute decompensated HF (new onset, likely viral myocarditis)**
   - Temporary LVAD (Impella CP) placed for hemodynamic support
   - Titrated vasopressors, now off
   - Guideline-directed medical therapy for HF to be initiated as tolerated
   - Monitor for arrhythmias, LVAD-related complications, end-organ perfusion
   - Serial TTEs, labs

**2. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, improved)**
   - Likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   - Diuresis, renal function improved
   - Monitor UOP, daily BMP

**3. Fulminant viral myocarditis**
   - Supportive care, viral PCR sent (pending)
   - No immunosuppression at this time

**4. Volume overload/pulmonary edema**
   - IV diuresis, fluid restriction
   - Monitor daily weights, CXR as needed

**5. Possible secondary bacterial infection**
   - Empiric antibiotics given, discontinued after negative cultures

**6. Dyslipidemia, obesity**
   - Resume statin when stable
   - Dietician consult

**7. Menstrual suppression/IUD**
   - Continue current regimen

**8. Pain**
   - Acetaminophen prn

---

### DISPOSITION / NEXT STEPS
- Remain in ICU for LVAD monitoring, hemodynamic optimization
- Expectation for LVAD wean and removal within next 48–72 hours if stable
- Cardiology to follow for consideration of long-term GDMT and cardiac MRI outpatient
- PT/OT eval when appropriate
- Case management consult for discharge planning

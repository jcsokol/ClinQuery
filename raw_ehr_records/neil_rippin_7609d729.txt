### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Neil Rippin is an 80-year-old male with a complex cardiac history (coronary artery disease, prior stroke, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and multiple chronic comorbidities, who presented to the ED with acute-onset substernal chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, and near-syncope. He had a recent upper respiratory infection and persistent cough. He was found to be hypotensive (SBP 78 mmHg), tachycardic, and hypoxic (O2 sat 87% RA). Initial EKG showed anterior STEMI. He was emergently transferred to the cath lab, where he was found to have severe 3-vessel disease with acute thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD. He developed profound cardiogenic shock post-PCI, requiring the placement of a temporary percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support.

### HOSPITAL COURSE (DAYS 1–8)

- **Day 1:** Admitted to MICU after PCI. Impella CP placed. Started on norepinephrine, vasopressin, and dobutamine drips. Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. Labs notable for AKI (Cr 3.1), mild transaminitis, and anemia.  
- **Day 2:** Remained on vasopressors. Lactate trended down. UOP improved with diuresis.  
- **Day 3:** Weaned off norepi, Impella flows stable. Started empiric cefepime for possible aspiration pneumonia.  
- **Day 4:** Extubated to BiPAP. Still requiring Impella, but improving mental status.  
- **Day 5:** Impella weaning trial successful. Device removed. Transitioned to low-dose dobutamine only.  
- **Day 6:** Developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, rate-controlled with metoprolol.  
- **Day 7:** Stable. Transferred from MICU to stepdown.  
- **Day 8:** Ambulating with PT. Discharge planning initiated.

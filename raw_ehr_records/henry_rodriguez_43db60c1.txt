CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath, chest pain, and syncopal episode

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
21-year-old male with PMH notable for recent left ankle fracture (ORIF 5/2024) and acute viral pharyngitis, presented to ED with acute onset chest pain and severe SOB 3 days after developing a sore throat. On arrival found to be tachycardic, hypotensive, hypoxic. Cardiac enzymes elevated. Echo with severe global LV dysfunction (EF ~10%). Patient rapidly deteriorated, requiring intubation and vasopressors. Emergent placement of percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for cardiogenic shock, transferred to MICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Fracture of left ankle, s/p ORIF
- Acute viral pharyngitis (recent)
- No known CAD, HTN, DM
- No prior heart failure

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
- ORIF left ankle (5/2024)

FAMILY HISTORY:
- Noncontributory

SOCIAL HISTORY:
- College student, non-smoker, no EtOH, no illicits

ALLERGIES:
- NKDA

HOME MEDICATIONS:
- Acetaminophen 325 mg PO PRN

HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:
- Day 1: Admitted to ICU for acute decompensated heart failure, likely viral myocarditis (suspect coxsackie/adenovirus). Required intubation, norepinephrine, and dobutamine. Emergent Impella CP placed for refractory shock.
- Day 2: Remained in cardiogenic shock. Mild transaminitis, AKI, elevated troponin. Infectious workup sent. Started on broad-spectrum abx (vanc/cefepime) pending cultures.
- Day 3: Improving hemodynamics, Impella weaning trial started. Extubated.
- Day 4: LVEF improved to 28% on repeat echo. Impella removed. Renal and hepatic function normalizing.
- Day 5: Ambulating with PT, transferred to stepdown.

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:
- CXR: Bilateral interstitial opacities, mild pulmonary edema
- ECG: Sinus tachycardia, low voltage, nonspecific ST-T changes
- Echo (5/18): Severe LV systolic dysfunction, EF 10%, no valve vegetations
- Echo (5/21): LVEF improved to 28%, mild MR, no thrombus
- Lower extremity duplex: No DVT

PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN

**1. Cardiogenic shock, likely viral myocarditis**
   - Emergent Impella CP placed for mechanical circulatory support
   - Vasopressors/inotropes (norepi, dobutamine) weaned off by day 3
   - Serial ECHOs to monitor recovery
   - Cardiac enzymes trending down
   - Plan: Continue GDMT for heart failure, monitor for arrhythmias, consider biopsy if no further improvement

**2. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, intubated**
   - Intubated for 48 hrs, now extubated
   - Supportive care, pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR

**3. Acute kidney injury (pre-renal, multifactorial)**
   - Creatinine peaked at 2.2, improved with perfusion
   - Fluid balance closely monitored
   - Plan: Continue to monitor, renally-dose all medications

**4. Transaminitis, likely ischemic hepatitis**
   - AST/ALT peaked on day 2, improved as hemodynamics stabilized
   - No evidence of biliary obstruction or hemolysis

**5. Recent viral pharyngitis**
   - Throat culture and respiratory viral panel sent
   - Supportive care

**6. Fracture left ankle, s/p ORIF**
   - Immobilized, cleared by ortho for weight-bearing as tolerated on 5/21
   - PT/OT involved

**7. Infection prophylaxis**
   - Empiric abx started for possible sepsis, discontinued on day 3 when cultures negative

**8. DVT prophylaxis**
   - SCDs, subQ heparin

**9. Nutrition**
   - Enteral feeds started day 2, transitioned to regular diet

**10. Disposition**
   - Anticipate transfer to stepdown, will require close f/u with Heart Failure/Cardiology
   - Education initiated on new diagnosis and lifestyle modification

**Medications (current):**
- Acetaminophen 325 mg PO PRN
- Lisinopril 2.5 mg PO daily (initiated day 4)
- Carvedilol 3.125 mg PO BID (initiated day 4)
- Furosemide 20 mg IV BID (weaning)
- Heparin 5000 U SQ q8h
- Pantoprazole 40 mg IV daily

**Consults:**
- Cardiology (primary)
- Infectious Disease (viral myocarditis)
- Physical Therapy
- Nutrition

**To Do / Recommendations:**
- Monitor labs daily
- Echo in 1 week
- Cardiac MRI if stable
- Arrange close outpatient follow-up

## Chief Complaint
Progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and chest pressure x 1 week.

---

## HPI
69-year-old male with PMH significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic sinusitis, presented to ED with acute dyspnea, cough, and subjective fevers. On arrival, noted to be tachypneic, hypoxic, and hypotensive. Rapid decompensation requiring transfer to ICU. Initial workup notable for elevated troponin, new LBBB, and severe global LV dysfunction on TTE (EF 15%). Developed cardiogenic shock refractory to pressors; required urgent placement of a percutaneous LVAD (Impella CP) for hemodynamic support. 

Course complicated by AKI (creatinine peaked at 2.3), transient transaminitis, and persistent leukocytosis. Treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible superimposed pneumonia.

## Problem-Based Assessment and Plan

### 1. Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Severe Acute Systolic Heart Failure
- Etiology likely viral myocarditis vs. demand ischemia (troponin I 2.5, new LBBB, no prior CAD)
- Impella CP placed on ICU day 1 for hemodynamic support; weaning not yet tolerated
- MAP goal >65, currently off vasopressors
- Serial TTEs: no tamponade, LV EF 15-18%, RV function preserved
- Continue Impella support, daily device checks
- Monitor for hemolysis, limb ischemia, infection
- Cardiology to reevaluate for possible device wean vs. escalation (ECMO) if no improvement

### 2. Acute Kidney Injury (Stage 2)
- Creatinine up from baseline 1.1 to peak 2.3 on ICU day 2, now 1.8
- Likely multifactorial: low cardiac output, nephrotoxic meds, hypoperfusion
- Strict I/Os, furosemide as needed, avoid nephrotoxins
- Renal consult: no indication for RRT at present

### 3. Transaminitis
- ALT peaked at 212, AST 187, now trending down
- Likely ischemic hepatitis in context of shock
- Monitor LFTs, trend daily

### 4. Leukocytosis, Fever
- WBC up to 17.2 on day 2, now 13.8
- CXR: mild bibasilar opacities, possible atelectasis vs. early PNA
- Blood/sputum cultures negative to date
- Continue empiric cefepime/vancomycin, de-escalate as appropriate

### 5. Chronic Sinusitis/Pharyngitis
- On home amox/clav; continue until course complete
- ENT to follow outpatient

### 6. Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia
- Continue home statin
- Hold lisinopril for hypotension

### 7. DVT Prophylaxis
- SCDs in place; heparin SQ BID
- Lower extremity duplex negative for DVT

### 8. Nutrition, Disposition, Rehabilitation
- NPO until further swallow eval
- PT/OT consults for early mobilization
- Social work to assist with discharge planning

## Hospital Course Summary

Mr. Gleason was admitted with acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to viral myocarditis, with no prior history of heart disease. Required rapid escalation to temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP). Over the course of 5 days, his end-organ perfusion improved, renal and hepatic indices gradually normalized, and he was weaned off vasopressors. Plan is for slow wean of Impella with close hemodynamic and echocardiographic monitoring. Will require aggressive medical therapy for heart failure, close cardiology follow-up, and ultimately consideration for advanced therapies if LV function does not recover.

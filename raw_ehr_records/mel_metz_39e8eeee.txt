**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**

Mr. Mel Metz is a 102-year-old male with past medical history notable for DM2 (insulin + metformin), CKD stage 2, CHF with reduced EF (last 38%), prior CVA, metabolic syndrome, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, who presented to the ED with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema over the past week. He was found to be hypoxic (O2 sat 84% RA), hypertensive (BP 172/88), tachycardic (HR 113), and in moderate distress. Initial labs revealed hyperglycemia, acute on chronic anemia, and worsening renal function. EKG showed NSR, old inferior Q waves. CXR: pulmonary edema. Echo: EF 34%, moderate MR, dilated LV.

He acutely decompensated on hospital day 2 with hypotension unresponsive to diuresis and escalating O2 needs; started on dobutamine and transferred to ICU. Cardiogenic shock diagnosed. Emergent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP) was performed with transient hemodynamic improvement. Complicated course with AKI, fluid overload, and infection.

**PROBLEM-BASED ASSESSMENT & PLAN**

**1. Cardiogenic Shock / Acute on Chronic HFrEF**
   - Decompensated CHF with hypotension, AKI, and pulmonary edema.
   - Required inotropes (dobutamine), then percutaneous LV assist device (Impella CP) on HD#2.
   - Diuresis with IV Lasix, daily weights, I/O monitoring.
   - Titrated beta-blocker, held during shock.
   - Afterload reduction: cautious ACE-I (held for AKI).
   - Plan: Wean Impella as tolerated, transition to oral meds. Cardiology following. Consider palliative goals if further decline.

**2. Acute Kidney Injury on CKD2**
   - Baseline Cr ~2.0, peaked at 4.3, now 3.5.
   - Likely multifactorial (cardiorenal, diuretic, hypoperfusion).
   - Strict I/Os, nephrology consult.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, adjust renally cleared meds.
   - Monitor for indication for RRT.

**3. Diabetes Mellitus, poorly controlled**
   - Hyperglycemia on admission, required insulin drip in ICU.
   - Resume sliding scale insulin, monitor A1c (last 10.1%), hold metformin for AKI.
   - Endocrinology consult for glycemic management.

**4. Anemia**
   - Chronic, worsened by AKI (EPO deficiency), possible dilutional component.
   - Hgb nadir 7.1, transfused PRBCs x2.
   - Monitor for GI loss, iron studies pending.

**5. Chronic Sinusitis / Recent Viral URI**
   - Mild congestion, afebrile, no acute bacterial infection.
   - Supportive care.

**6. Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy / Macular Edema**
   - No acute vision changes. Ophtho consulted.
   - Continue home eye drops.

**7. Chronic Antiplatelet/Anticoagulation**
   - Clopidogrel continued due to prior CVA, risk/benefit discussed.

**8. Metabolic Syndrome / Hypertriglyceridemia**
   - Triglycerides mildly elevated.
   - Statin held due to LFT elevation, re-evaluate as LFTs normalize.

**9. History of Stroke (2021)**
   - No new deficits. Continue DVT prophylaxis.

**10. Pain Management**
   - Rare meperidine use, mostly acetaminophen.
   - Avoid NSAIDs (AKI).

**11. Nutrition**
   - Poor PO intake, diabetic renal diet.
   - Consider nutritionist consult.

**12. Disposition/Social**
   - Daughter involved in care, full code.
   - Anticipate prolonged rehab needs.

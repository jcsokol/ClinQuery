*** ICU Progress Note ***

Chief Complaint:
Acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support (Impella CP).

History of Present Illness:
23-year-old female with PMH significant for morbid obesity (BMI 49), childhood asthma, allergic rhinitis, recurrent viral sinusitis, and recent streptococcal pharyngitis, who was admitted with 3 days of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, cough, and lower extremity edema. Initial ED evaluation revealed hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and evidence of acute pulmonary edema on CXR. Labs notable for elevated troponin, BNP, and transaminitis. Echo showed severe global LV dysfunction (EF 15%). She decompensated on the floor with worsening shock, requiring transfer to the MICU, intubation, and placement of a temporary LV assist device (Impella CP) for refractory cardiogenic shock. Course complicated by AKI, transaminitis, and healthcare-associated pneumonia.

Hospital Course Summary:
- Day 1: Admitted for acute HF, started on BiPAP, IV furosemide, nitroglycerin, and inotropes.
- Day 2: Intubated for hypoxemic resp. failure, escalating pressors. Echo: Severe LV dysfunction. Transferred to MICU.
- Day 3: Impella CP placed at bedside. Improved hemodynamics; pressors weaned.
- Day 4-5: Persistent AKI, rising LFTs, developed fever and new infiltrate—started on empiric vancomycin/pip-tazo.
- Day 6: Gradual improvement, Impella weaned, extubated.
- Day 7: Transferred out of ICU to telemetry.

Problem List with Assessment & Plan:

1. **Cardiogenic Shock, Severe LV Dysfunction (EF 15%)**
   - Hx: No prior cardiac hx, likely viral myocarditis vs. stress-induced cardiomyopathy.
   - Course: Decompensated, requiring Impella CP for 4d.
   - Plan:
     - Continue guideline-directed medical therapy for HF (carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan started).
     - Close hemodynamic monitoring, daily weights.
     - Cardiology f/u, consider cardiac MRI as outpatient.
     - Taper diuretics as tolerated.

2. **Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO Stage 2)**
   - Likely multifactorial: hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic abx, contrast.
   - Plan:
     - Monitor renal function, avoid nephrotoxins.
     - Diuretics for volume status.
     - Renal consult if Cr worsens.

3. **Transaminitis**
   - Likely ischemic hepatitis from shock.
   - Plan:
     - Monitor LFTs q48h.
     - Supportive care, avoid hepatotoxins.

4. **Nosocomial Pneumonia**
   - Pseudomonas on sputum culture.
   - Plan:
     - Continue pip-tazo x7d total.
     - Monitor for clinical improvement, repeat CXR if indicated.

5. **Morbid Obesity**
   - BMI 49, risk factor for HF, OSA, metabolic syndrome.
   - Plan:
     - Nutritional consult, calorie restriction.
     - Encourage mobilization as able.

6. **Asthma and Allergic Rhinitis**
   - Stable, continue home inhalers and loratadine.
   - Monitor for bronchospasm.

7. **Contraception**
   - Continue current regimen.
   - Counsel re: risks with cardiac disease, obesity.

8. **DVT Prophylaxis**
   - SCDs, LMWH unless contraindicated.

9. **Psychosocial**
   - Discussed diagnosis and prognosis with patient/family.
   - Social work to assist with discharge planning.

Discharge Planning:
- Anticipate transfer to floor in 48h.
- Arrange close cardiology and nephrology follow-up.
- Outpt cardiac MRI, weight management referral.
